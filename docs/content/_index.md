This documentation website refers to the replication package for the paper *APIzation: Generating Reusable APIs from StackOverflow Code Snippets*.
We provide all the *APIzations* we produced with our tool.
Also, we include the data we used in our study.

The website is organized as follows:

1. [Study on APIzations](study) contains all the data we used to conduct our investigatory study to understand how developers perform APIzations.
2. [Evaluation of the approach](evaluation) includes everything regarded the evaluation part of our approach called **APIzator**.
3. [Search APIzations](search) provides a search engine for all the *APIzations* we produced by using *APIzator*.
