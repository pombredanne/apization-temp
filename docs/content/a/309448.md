If you have a java.io.InputStream object, how should you process that object and produce a String?
Suppose I have an InputStream that contains text data, and I want to convert it to a String, so for example I can write that to a log file.
What is the easiest way to take the InputStream and convert it to a String?

```java
public String convertStreamToString(InputStream is) { 
    // ???
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/309448

A nice way to do this is using Apache commons IOUtils to copy the InputStream into a StringWriter... something like
or even
Alternatively, you could use ByteArrayOutputStream if you don&#x27;t want to mix your Streams and Writers

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, encoding);
String theString = writer.toString();
// NB: does not close inputStream, you'll have to use try-with-resources for that
String theString = IOUtils.toString(inputStream, encoding);
```
