Say I have two strings,
I want to perform a check returning that s2 is contained within s1. I can do this with:
I am pretty sure that contains() is case sensitive, however I can&#x27;t determine this for sure from reading the documentation. If it is then I suppose my best method would be something like:
All this aside, is there another (possibly better) way to accomplish this without caring about case-sensitivity?


```java
String s1 = "AbBaCca";
String s2 = "bac";
return s1.contains(s2);
return s1.toLowerCase().contains(s2.toLowerCase());
```


## Original code snippet

Yes, contains is case sensitive.  You can use java.util.regex.Pattern with the CASE_INSENSITIVE flag for case insensitive matching:
EDIT: If s2 contains regex special characters (of which there are many) it&#x27;s important to quote it first.  I&#x27;ve corrected my answer since it is the first one people will see, but vote up Matt Quail&#x27;s since he pointed this out.

```java
Pattern.compile(Pattern.quote(s2), Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE).matcher(s1).find();
```
