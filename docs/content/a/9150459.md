Is it better to write
or
I think the second one is better, should be faster and more memory optimized. But aren&#x27;t they equal?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int primitive1 = 3, primitive2 = 4;
Integer a = new Integer(primitive1);
Integer b = new Integer(primitive2);
int compare = a.compareTo(b);
int primitive1 = 3, primitive2 = 4;
int compare = (primitive1 > primitive2) ? 1 : 0;
if(compare == 0){
    compare = (primitive1 == primitive2) ? 0 : -1;
}
```

For performance, it usually best to make the code as simple and clear as possible and this will often perform well (as the JIT will optimise this code best).  In your case, the simplest examples are also likely to be the fastest.
I would do either
or a longer version
or
Its best not to create an object if you don&#x27;t need to.
Performance wise, the first is best.
If you know for sure that you won&#x27;t get an overflow you can use
you won&#x27;t get faster than this.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int cmp = a > b ? +1 : a < b ? -1 : 0;
int cmp;
if (a > b)
   cmp = +1;
else if (a < b)
   cmp = -1;
else
   cmp = 0;
int cmp = Integer.compare(a, b); // in Java 7
int cmp = Double.compare(a, b); // before Java 7
int cmp = a - b; // if you know there wont be an overflow.
```
