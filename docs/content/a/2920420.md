In Java I&#x27;m trying to test for a null value, from a ResultSet, where the column is being cast to a primitive int type.
From the code fragment above, is there a better way to do this, and I assume that the second wasNull() test is redundant?
Educate us, and Thanks

```java
int iVal;
ResultSet rs = magicallyAppearingStmt.executeQuery(query);
if (rs.next()) {
  if (rs.getObject("ID_PARENT") != null && !rs.wasNull()) {
    iVal = rs.getInt("ID_PARENT");
  }
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2920420

The default for ResultSet.getInt when the field value is NULL is to return 0, which is also the default value for your iVal declaration. In which case your test is completely redundant.
If you actually want to do something different if the field value is NULL, I suggest:
(Edited as @martin comments below; the OP code as written would not compile because iVal is not initialised)

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int iVal = 0;
ResultSet rs = magicallyAppearingStmt.executeQuery(query);
if (rs.next()) {
    iVal = rs.getInt("ID_PARENT");
    if (rs.wasNull()) {
        // handle NULL field value
    }
}
```
