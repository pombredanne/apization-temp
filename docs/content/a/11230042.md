Note - in the above question, by \"character\" I don't mean the char data type, but a letter or number in a string.

I know how to work out the index of a certain character or number in a string, but is there any predefined method I can use to give me the character at the nth position? So in the string &quot;foo&quot;, if I asked for the character with index 0 it would return &quot;f&quot;.
Note - in the above question, by &quot;character&quot; I don&#x27;t mean the char data type, but a letter or number in a string. The important thing here is that I don&#x27;t receive a char when the method is invoked, but a string (of length 1). And I know about the substring() method, but I was wondering if there was a neater way.

The method you&#x27;re looking for is charAt. Here&#x27;s an example:
For more information, see the Java documentation on String.charAt. If you want another simple tutorial, this one or this one.
If you don&#x27;t want the result as a char data type, but rather as a string, you would use the Character.toString method:
If you want more information on the Character class and the toString method, I pulled my info from the documentation on Character.toString.

```java
String text = "foo";
char a_char = text.charAt(0);
System.out.println(a_char); // Prints f
String text = "foo";
String a_letter = Character.toString(text.charAt(0));
System.out.println( a_letter ); // Prints f
```
