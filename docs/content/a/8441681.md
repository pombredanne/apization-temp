I have some data structures, and I would like to use one as a temporary, and another as not temporary.
now the problem with this of course is that myObject is really just pointing to myTempObject, and so once myTempObject is cleared, so is myObject.
How do I retain the values from myTempObject in myObject using java?


```java
ArrayList<Object> myObject = new ArrayList<Object>();
ArrayList<Object> myTempObject = new ArrayList<Object>();


//fill myTempObject here
....

//make myObject contain the same values as myTempObject
myObject = myTempObject;

//free up memory by clearing myTempObject
myTempObject.clear();
```

You can use such trick:
or use
You can get some information about clone() method here
But you should remember, that all these ways will give you a copy of your List, not all of its elements. So if you change one of the elements in your copied List, it will also be changed in your original List.

```java
myObject = new ArrayList<Object>(myTempObject);
myObject = (ArrayList<Object>)myTempObject.clone();
```
