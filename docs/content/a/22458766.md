What is the main difference between next() and nextLine()?
My main goal is to read the all text using a Scanner which may be &quot;connected&quot; to any source (file for example).
Which one should I choose and why?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/22458766

I always prefer to read input using nextLine() and then parse the string.
Using next() will only return what comes before a space. nextLine() automatically moves the scanner down after returning the current line.
A useful tool for parsing data from nextLine() would be str.split(&quot;\\s+&quot;).
For more information regarding the Scanner class or String class refer to the following links.
Scanner: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
String: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html

```java
String data = scanner.nextLine();
String[] pieces = data.split("\\s+");
// Parse the pieces
```
