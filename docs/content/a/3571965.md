OK let&#x27;s say I have an array filled with {&quot;tube&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;fun&quot;} and then I have a JTextField and if I type either one of those commands to do something and if NOT to get like a message saying &quot;Command not found&quot;.
I tried looking in Java docs but all I am getting is things that I don&#x27;t want like questions and stuff... so, how is this done? I know there is a &quot;in array&quot; function but I&#x27;m not too good with combining the two together.
Thanks.
Here is what I have so far:
but I am getting cannot find symbol in dan.contains


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String[] dan = {"Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Violet", "Orange", "Blue"};
boolean contains = dan.contains(say.getText());
```


## Original code snippet

This is what you&#x27;re looking for:
If you have a list of not repeated values, prefer using a Set&lt;String&gt; which has the same contains method

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
List<String> dan = Arrays.asList("Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Violet", "Orange", "Blue");

boolean contains = dan.contains(say.getText());
```
