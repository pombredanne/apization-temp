What&#x27;s the correct way to get a JFrame to close, the same as if the user had hit the X close button, or pressed Alt+F4 (on Windows)?

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1235994

If you want the GUI to behave as if you clicked the X close button then you need to dispatch a window closing event to the Window. The ExitAction from Closing An Application allows you to add this functionality to a menu item or any component that uses Actions easily.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
frame.dispatchEvent(new WindowEvent(frame, WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING));
```
