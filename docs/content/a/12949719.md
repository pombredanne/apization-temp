I need to add elements to an ArrayList queue whatever, but when I call the function to add an element, I want it to add the element at the beginning of the array (so it has the lowest index) and if the array has 10 elements adding a new results in deleting the oldest element (the one with the highest index).
Does anyone have any suggestions?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/12949719

List has the method add(int, E), so you can use:
Afterwards you can delete the last element with:
However, you might want to rethink your requirements or use a different data structure, like a Queue
EDIT
Maybe have a look at Apache&#x27;s CircularFifoQueue:
CircularFifoQueue is a first-in first-out queue with a fixed size that replaces its oldest element if full.
Just initialize it with you maximum size:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
list.add(0, yourObject);
if(list.size() > 10)
    list.remove(list.size() - 1);
CircularFifoQueue queue = new CircularFifoQueue(10);
```
