During my work with databases I noticed that I write query strings and in this strings I have to put several restrictions in the where-clause from a list/array/collection. Should look like this:
You can simplify this by reducing this to the question that you have collection of strings and want to create a comma-separated list of this strings in just one string.
My approach I have used so far is something like that:
But this is as you can see very ugly. You cannot see what happens there on the first look, especially when the constructed strings (like every SQL query) is getting complicated.
What is your (more) elegant way?


```java
select * from customer 
where customer.id in (34, 26, ..., 2);
String result = "";
boolean first = true;
for(String string : collectionOfStrings) {
    if(first) {
        result+=string;
        first=false;
    } else {
        result+=","+string;
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

Since strings are immutable, you may want to use the StringBuilder class if you&#x27;re going to alter the String in the code.
The StringBuilder class can be seen as a mutable String object which allocates more memory when its content is altered.
The original suggestion in the question can be written even more clearly and efficiently, by taking care of the redundant trailing comma:

```java
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for(String string : collectionOfStrings) {
        result.append(string);
        result.append(",");
    }
    return result.length() > 0 ? result.substring(0, result.length() - 1): "";
```
