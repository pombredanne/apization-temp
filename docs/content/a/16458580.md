I have String name = &quot;admin&quot;;
then I do String char = name.substring(0,1); //char=&quot;a&quot;
I want to convert the char to its ASCII value (97), how can I do this in java?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/16458580

Very simple. Just cast your char as an int.
In your case, you need to get the specific Character from the String first and then cast it.
Though cast is not required explicitly, but its improves readability.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
char character = 'a';    
int ascii = (int) character;
char character = name.charAt(0); // This gives the character 'a'
int ascii = (int) character; // ascii is now 97.
int ascii = character; // Even this will do the trick.
```
