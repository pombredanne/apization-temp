I&#x27;m trying to take the last three chracters of any string and save it as another String variable. I&#x27;m having some tough time with my thought process.
I don&#x27;t know how to use the getChars method when it comes to buffer or index. Eclipse is making me have those in there. Any suggestions?


```java
String word = "onetwotwoone"
int length = word.length();
String new_word = id.getChars(length-3, length, buffer, index);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15253450

Why not just String substr = word.substring(word.length() - 3)?
Update
Please make sure you check that the String is at least 3 characters long before calling substring():

```java
if (word.length() == 3) {
  return word;
} else if (word.length() > 3) {
  return word.substring(word.length() - 3);
} else {
  // whatever is appropriate in this case
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("word has less than 3 characters!");
}
```
