I would like to append a new line to an existing file without erasing the current information of that file. In short, here is the methodology that I am using the current time:
The problem with the above lines is simply they are erasing all the contents of my existing file then adding the new line text.
I want to append some text at the end of the contents of a file without erasing or replacing anything.


```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.Writer;

Writer output;
output = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(my_file_name));  //clears file every time
output.append("New Line!");
output.close();
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4614244

you have to open the file in append mode, which can be achieved by using the FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append) constructor.
should do the trick

```java
output = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(my_file_name, true));
```
