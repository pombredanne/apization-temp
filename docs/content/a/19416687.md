I have the following directory layout:
Within a ServletContextListener class, I want to access the files under the SQL directory and list them. Basically my problem is with the path, because I know that listing files under a directory in a nutshell is:
Maybe I could use the ServletContextEvent Object to try and build a path to resources/sql
Does something exist to set that path in a relative, non-hardcoded way?
Something like new File(&quot;classpath:sql&quot;) (preferably spring if possible) or what should I do with the servletContext to point at resources/sql?


```java
File folder = new File(path);
File[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();
public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) {
    event.getServletContext(); //(getRealPath etc.)
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/19416687

I&#x27;m assuming the contents of src/main/resources/ is copied to WEB-INF/classes/ inside your .war at build time. If that is the case you can just do (substituting real values for the classname and the path being loaded).

```java
URL sqlScriptUrl = MyServletContextListener.class
                       .getClassLoader().getResource("sql/script.sql");
```
