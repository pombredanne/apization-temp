Can an int be null in Java?
For example:
My goal is to write a function which returns an int. Said int is stored in the height of a node, and if the node is not present, it will be null, and I&#x27;ll need to check that.
I am doing this for homework but this specific part is not part of the homework, it just helps me get through what I am doing.
Thanks for the comments, but it seems very few people have actually read what&#x27;s under the code, I was asking how else I can accomplish this goal; it was easy to figure out that it doesn&#x27;t work.

```java
int data = check(Node root);

if ( data == null ) {
 // do something
} else {
 // do something
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2254463

int can&#x27;t be null, but Integer can. You need to be careful when unboxing null Integers since this can cause a lot of confusion and head scratching!
e.g. this:
will give you a NullPointerException, despite object not being null!
To follow up on your question, if you want to indicate the absence of a value, I would investigate java.util.Optional&lt;Integer&gt;

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int a = object.getA(); // getA returns a null Integer
```
