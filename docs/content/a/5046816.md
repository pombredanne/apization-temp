In other words, I want functionality that provides Joda-Time:
but without Joda-Time, only with java.util.Date.
Methods such as .setHours() and etc. are deprecated. Is there are more correct way?


```java
today = today.withTime(0, 0, 0, 0);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5046816

Since the methods are deprecated, you can do this with Calendar:
And if you need a Date object in the end, simply call today.getTime()

```java
Date today = new Date();
today.setHours(0); //same for minutes and seconds
Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();
today.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0); // same for minutes and seconds
```
