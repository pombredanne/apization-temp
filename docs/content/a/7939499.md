I&#x27;m writing an application that has 5 threads that get some information from web simultaneously and fill 5 different fields in a buffer class.
I need to validate buffer data and store it in a database when all threads finished their job.
How can I do this (get alerted when all threads finished their work) ?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/7939499

The approach I take is to use an ExecutorService to manage pools of threads.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
ExecutorService es = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
    es.execute(new Runnable() { /*  your task */ });
es.shutdown();
boolean finshed = es.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
// all tasks have finished or the time has been reached.
```
