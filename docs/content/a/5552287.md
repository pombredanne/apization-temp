In practice, is it better to return an empty list like this:
Or like this:
Or is this completely dependent upon what you&#x27;re going to do with the returned list?

The main difference is that Collections.emptyList() returns an immutable list, i.e., a list to which you cannot add elements.
In the rare cases in which you do want to modify the returned list, this would thus not be an option.
I&#x27;d say that returning an immutable list is perfectly fine (and even the preferred way) as long as the contract (documentation) does not explicitly state differently.
In addition, emptyList() might not create a new object with each call.
Implementations of this method need not create a separate List object for each call. Using this method is likely to have comparable cost to using the like-named field. (Unlike this method, the field does not provide type safety.)
The implementation of emptyList looks as follows:
So if your method (which returns an empty list) is called very often, this approach may even give you slightly better performance both CPU and memory wise.
