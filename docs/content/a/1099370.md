What&#x27;s the difference between getPath(), getAbsolutePath(), and getCanonicalPath() in Java?
And when do I use each one?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1099370

Consider these filenames:
C:\temp\file.txt - This is a path, an absolute path, and a canonical path.
.\file.txt - This is a path. It&#x27;s neither an absolute path nor a canonical path.
C:\temp\myapp\bin\..\\..\file.txt - This is a path and an absolute path. It&#x27;s not a canonical path.
A canonical path is always an absolute path.
Converting from a path to a canonical path makes it absolute (usually tack on the current working directory so e.g. ./file.txt becomes c:/temp/file.txt). The  canonical path of a file just &quot;purifies&quot; the path, removing and resolving stuff like ..\ and resolving symlinks (on unixes).
Also note the following example with nio.Paths:
While both paths refer to the same location, the output will be quite different:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String canonical_path_string = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\";
String absolute_path_string = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\..\\";

System.out.println(Paths.get(canonical_path_string).getParent());
System.out.println(Paths.get(absolute_path_string).getParent());
C:\Windows
C:\Windows\System32\drivers
```
