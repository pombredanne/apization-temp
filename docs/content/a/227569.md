Does anyone know how to programmaticly find out where the java classloader actually loads the class from?

Here&#x27;s an example:
This printed out:

```java
package foo;

public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        ClassLoader loader = Test.class.getClassLoader();
        System.out.println(loader.getResource("foo/Test.class"));
    }
}
file:/C:/Users/Jon/Test/foo/Test.class
```
