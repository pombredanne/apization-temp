Say we have these two Runnables:
Then what&#x27;s the difference between this:
And this:


```java
class R1 implements Runnable {
    public void run() { … }
    …
}

class R2 implements Runnable {
    public void run() { … }
    …
}
public static void main() {
    R1 r1 = new R1();
    R2 r2 = new R2();

    r1.run();
    r2.run();
}
public static void main() {
    R1 r1 = new R1();
    R2 r2 = new R2();
    Thread t1 = new Thread(r1);
    Thread t2 = new Thread(r2);

    t1.start();
    t2.start();
}
```


## Original code snippet

First example: No multiple threads. Both execute in single (existing) thread. No thread creation.
r1 and r2 are just two different objects of classes that implement the Runnable interface and thus implement the run() method.  When you call r1.run() you are executing it in the current thread.
Second example: Two separate threads.
t1 and t2 are objects of the class Thread.  When you call t1.start(), it starts a new thread and calls the run() method of r1 internally to execute it within that new thread.

```java
R1 r1 = new R1();
R2 r2 = new R2();
Thread t1 = new Thread(r1);
Thread t2 = new Thread(r2);
```
