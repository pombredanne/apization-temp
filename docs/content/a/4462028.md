I&#x27;m trying to make my code more readable, so I decided to use some short IF statements.
Here&#x27;s my code which doesn&#x27;t work (&quot;not a statement&quot;):
What&#x27;s wrong with this? Needs brackets? Where?


```java
jXPanel6.isVisible() ? jXPanel6.setVisible(true) : jXPanel6.setVisible(false);
```

The &quot;ternary expression&quot; x ? y : z can only be used for conditional assignment.  That is, you could do something like:
because the ternary expression is returning something (of type String in this example).
It&#x27;s not really meant to be used as a short, in-line if-else.  In particular, you can&#x27;t use it if the individual parts don&#x27;t return a value, or return values of incompatible types.  (So while you could do this if both method happened to return the same value, you shouldn&#x27;t invoke it for the side-effect purposes only).

Both of those latter expressions are, for me, more readable in that they more clearly communicate what it is you&#x27;re trying to do.  (And by the way, did you get your conditions the wrong way round?  It looks like this is a no-op anyway, rather than a toggle).
Don&#x27;t mix up low character count with readability.  The key point is what is most easily understood; and mildly misusing language features is a definite way to confuse readers, or at least make them do a mental double-take.

```java
String mood = inProfit() ? "happy" : "sad";
if (jXPanel6.isVisible()) {
    jXPanel6.setVisible(true);
}
else {
    jXPanel6.setVisible(false);

jXPanel6.setVisible(jXPanel6.isVisible());
