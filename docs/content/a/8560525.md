I am beginner in Java, and I was reading the topic of giving values to variables through the readLine() method from the keyboard. The program for that is given in the book is as follows:
I want to ask the following questions:
What is done in the following statement?
If in is an object of DataInputStream then what is new and what do the statement on the right-hand side of above statement do?
Why have different methods been used for putting the integer value into intnumber and float value into floatnumber?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import java.io.DataInputStream
class Reading
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(System.in);
        int intnumber=0;
        float floatnumber=0.0f;
        try {
            system.out.println("enter an integer: ");
            intnumber = Integer.parseInt(in.readline());

            system.out.println("enter a float number: ");
            floatnumber = Float.valueOf(in.readline()).floatvalue();
        }

        // Rest of code
DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(System.in);
```


## Original code snippet

I advise you to go with Scanner instead of DataInputStream. Scanner is specifically designed for this purpose and introduced in Java 5. See the following links to know how to use Scanner.
Example

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.next());
System.out.println(s.next());
```
