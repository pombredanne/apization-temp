Say, I have a method that returns a custom List with some objects. They are returned as Object to me. I need to get value of a certain field from these objects, but I don&#x27;t know the objects&#x27; class.
Is there a way to do this via Reflecion or somehow else?

Assuming a simple case, where your field is public:
But this is pretty ugly, and I left out all of the try-catches, and makes a number of assumptions (public field, reflection available, nice security manager).
If you can change your method to return a List&lt;Foo&gt;, this becomes very easy because the iterator then can give you type information:
Or if you&#x27;re consuming a Java 1.4 interface where generics aren&#x27;t available, but you know the type of the objects that should be in the list...
No reflection needed :)

```java
List list; // from your method
for(Object x : list) {
    Class<?> clazz = x.getClass();
    Field field = clazz.getField("fieldName"); //Note, this can throw an exception if the field doesn't exist.
    Object fieldValue = field.get(x);
}
List<Foo> list; //From your method
for(Foo foo:list) {
    Object fieldValue = foo.fieldName;
}
List list;
for(Object x: list) {
   if( x instanceof Foo) {
      Object fieldValue = ((Foo)x).fieldName;
   }
}
