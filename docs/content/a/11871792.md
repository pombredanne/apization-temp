How could I read input from the console using the Scanner class? Something like this:
Basically, all I want is have the scanner read an input for the username, and assign the input to a String variable.


```java
System.out.println("Enter your username: ");
Scanner = input(); // Or something like this, I don't know the code
```


## Original code snippet

A simple example to illustrate how java.util.Scanner works would be reading a single integer from System.in. It&#x27;s really quite simple.
To retrieve a username I would probably use sc.nextLine().
You could also use next(String pattern) if you want more control over the input, or just validate the username variable.
You&#x27;ll find more information on their implementation in the API Documentation for java.util.Scanner

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int i = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println("Enter your username: ");
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String username = scanner.nextLine();
System.out.println("Your username is " + username);
```
