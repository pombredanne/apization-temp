I&#x27;d like to know if I can get the first element of a list or set.  Which method to use?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/8882317

(This is the closest you&#x27;ll get to having the &quot;first&quot; element of a Set.  You should realize that it has absolutely no meaning for most implementations of Set.  This may have meaning for LinkedHashSet and TreeSet, but not for HashSet.)

```java
Collection c;

Iterator iter = c.iterator();

Object first = iter.next();
```
