I&#x27;ve the enum type ReportTypeEnum that get passed between methods in all my classes but I then need to pass this on the URL so I use the ordinal method to get the int value. After I get it in my other JSP page, I need to convert it to back to an ReportTypeEnum so that I can continue passing it.
How can I convert ordinal to the ReportTypeEnum?
Using Java 6 SE.

To convert an ordinal into its enum represantation you might want to do this:
Please notice the array bounds.
Note that every call to values() returns a newly cloned array which might impact performance in a negative way. You may want to cache the array if it&#x27;s going to be called often.
Code example on how to cache values().
