I want to get the key of a HashMap using the value.
Which means i want a function that will take the value 100 and will return the string one.
It seems that there are a lot of questions here asking the same thing but they don&#x27;t work for me.
Maybe because i am new with java.
How to do it?

```java
hashmap = new HashMap<String, Object>();

haspmap.put("one", 100);
haspmap.put("two", 200);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/8113029

The put method in HashMap is defined like  this:
key is the first parameter, so in your put, &quot;one&quot; is the key. You can&#x27;t easily look up by value in a HashMap, if you really want to do that, it would be a linear search done by calling  entrySet(), like this:
However, that&#x27;s O(n) and kind of defeats the purpose of using a HashMap unless you only need to do it rarely. If you really want to be able to look up by key or value frequently, core Java doesn&#x27;t have anything for you, but something like BiMap from the Google Collections is what you want.

```java
Object  put(Object key, Object value)
for (Map.Entry<Object, Object> e : hashmap.entrySet()) {
    Object key = e.getKey();
    Object value = e.getValue();
}
```
