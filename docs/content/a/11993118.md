You can do this to execute a static method: But to execute a non-static method, you must do this: On a deeper level, when the compiler puts a class together, it contains several pointers to methods. When those methods are executed it follows the pointers and executes the code at the far end. If a class is instantiated, the created object contains a pointer to the \"virtual method table\", which points to the methods to be called for that particular class in the inheritance hierarchy.

## Original code snippet

The basic paradigm in Java is that you write classes, and that those classes are instantiated. Instantiated objects (an instance of a class) have attributes associated with them (member variables) that affect their behavior; when the instance has its method executed it will refer to these variables.
However, all objects of a particular type might have behavior that is not dependent at all on member variables; these methods are best made static. By being static, no instance of the class is required to run the method.
You can do this to execute a static method:
But to execute a non-static method, you must do this:
On a deeper level, when the compiler puts a class together, it contains several pointers to methods. When those methods are executed it follows the pointers and executes the code at the far end. If a class is instantiated, the created object contains a pointer to the &quot;virtual method table&quot;, which points to the methods to be called for that particular class in the inheritance hierarchy. However, if the method is static, no &quot;virtual method table&quot; is needed: all calls to that method go to the exact same place in memory to execute the exact same code. For that reason, in high-performance systems it&#x27;s better to use a static method if you are not reliant on instance variables.

```java
MyObject.staticMethod();//Simply refers to the class's static code
MyObject obj = new MyObject();//Create an instance
obj.nonstaticMethod();//Refer to the instance's class's code
```
