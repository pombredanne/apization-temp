I&#x27;m looking for a clean and efficient method of declaring multiple variables of the same type and of the same value. Right now I have:
But I&#x27;m looking for something like:
Is this something that is possible to do in java? Keeping efficiency in mind.
EDIT: Several members have pointed out that this isn&#x27;t the norm and would confuse most people. Thank you for pointing this out. I think I&#x27;m going to stay away from this implementation then, but I greatly appreciate the answers below.

```java
String one = "", two = "", three = "" etc...
String one,two,three = ""
```


## Original code snippet

This should work with immutable objects. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense for mutable objects for example:
All the variables would be pointing to the same instance. Probably what you would need in that case is:
Or better yet use an array or a Collection.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String one, two, three;
one = two = three = "";
Person firstPerson, secondPerson, thirdPerson;
firstPerson = secondPerson = thirdPerson = new Person();
Person firstPerson = new Person();
Person secondPerson = new Person();
Person thirdPerson = new Person();
```
