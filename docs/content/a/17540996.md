Is there a way to get the path of main class of the running java program.
structure is
I want to get the path as D:\Project\bin\.
I tried System.getProperty(&quot;java.class.path&quot;); but the problem is, if I run like
Is there any way to do this?

Note that most class files are assembled into JAR files so this won&#x27;t work in every case (hence the IllegalStateException). However, you can locate the JAR that contains the class with this technique, and you can get the content of the class file by substituting a call to getResourceAsStream() in place of getResource(), and that will work whether the class is on the file system or in a JAR.


```java
D:/
|---Project
       |------bin
       |------src
java -classpath D:\Project\bin;D:\Project\src\  Main

Output 
Getting : D:\Project\bin;D:\Project\src\
Want    : D:\Project\bin
package foo;

public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        ClassLoader loader = Test.class.getClassLoader();
        System.out.println(loader.getResource("foo/Test.class"));
    }
}
file:/C:/Users/Jon/Test/foo/Test.class
URL main = Main.class.getResource("Main.class");
if (!"file".equalsIgnoreCase(main.getProtocol()))
  throw new IllegalStateException("Main class is not stored in a file.");
File path = new File(main.getPath());
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/17540996

Try this code:
replace &#x27;MyClass&#x27; with your class containing the main method.
Alternatively you can also use
Above mentioned System property provides
Path used to find directories and JAR archives containing class files.
  Elements of the class path are separated by a platform-specific
  character specified in the path.separator property.

```java
final File f = new File(MyClass.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath());
System.getProperty("java.class.path")
```
