I have been having trouble while attempting to use the nextLine() method from java.util.Scanner.
Here is what I tried:
Example #1: This example works as intended. The line String sentence = scanner.nextLine(); waits for input to be entered before continuing on to System.out.print(&quot;Enter an index:\t&quot;);.
This produces the output:
Example #2: This example does not work as intended. This example uses a while loop and and if - else structure to allow the user to choose what to do. Once the program gets to String sentence = scanner.nextLine();, it does not wait for input but instead executes the line System.out.print(&quot;Enter an index:\t&quot;);.
This produces the output:
Which makes it impossible to enter a sentence.
Why does example #2 not work as intended? The only difference between Ex. 1 and 2 is that Ex. 2 has a while loop and an if-else structure. I don&#x27;t understand why this affects the behavior of scanner.nextInt().


```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class TestRevised {
    public void menu() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a sentence:\t");
        String sentence = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter an index:\t");
        int index = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("\nYour sentence:\t" + sentence);
        System.out.println("Your index:\t" + index);
    }
}
Enter a sentence:   Hello.
Enter an index: 0

Your sentence:  Hello.
Your index: 0
// Example #2
import java.util.Scanner;

class Test {
    public void menu() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("\nMenu Options\n");
            System.out.println("(1) - do this");
            System.out.println("(2) - quit");

            System.out.print("Please enter your selection:\t");
            int selection = scanner.nextInt();

            if (selection == 1) {
                System.out.print("Enter a sentence:\t");
                String sentence = scanner.nextLine();

                System.out.print("Enter an index:\t");
                int index = scanner.nextInt();

                System.out.println("\nYour sentence:\t" + sentence);
                System.out.println("Your index:\t" + index);
            }
            else if (selection == 2) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
Menu Options

(1) - do this
(2) - quit

Please enter your selection:    1
Enter a sentence:   Enter an index:
```

I think your problem is that
reads just the number, not the end of line or anything after the number.  When you declare
This reads the remainder of the line with the number on it (with nothing after the number I suspect)
Try placing a scanner.nextLine(); after each nextInt() if you intend to ignore the rest of the line.

```java
int selection = scanner.nextInt();
String sentence = scanner.nextLine();
```
