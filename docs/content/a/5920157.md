I have a HashMap:
Now I would Like to run through all the values and print them.
I wrote this:
It doesn&#x27;t seem to work.
What is the problem?
EDIT:
Another question: Is this collection zero based? I mean if it has 1 key and value will the size be 0 or 1?


```java
private HashMap<TypeKey,TypeValue > example= new HashMap<TypeKey, TypeValue>();
for (TypeValue name: this.example.keySet()){

        System.out.println(name);
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5920157

keySet() only returns a set of keys from your hashmap, you should iterate this key set and the get the value from the hashmap using these keys.
In your example,  the type of the hashmap&#x27;s key is TypeKey, but you specified TypeValue in your generic for-loop, so it cannot be compiled. You should change it to :
If you don&#x27;t require to print key value and just need the hashmap value, you can use others&#x27; suggestions.
Another question: Is this collection
  is zero base? I mean if it has 1 key
  and value will it size be 0 or 1?
The collection returned from keySet() is a Set.You cannot get the value from a Set using an index, so it is not a question of whether it is zero-based or one-based. If your hashmap has one key, the keySet() returned will have one entry inside, and its size will be 1.

```java
for (TypeKey name: example.keySet()){

            String key =name.toString();
            String value = example.get(name).toString();  
            System.out.println(key + " " + value);  


}
```
