I&#x27;m running a web application in JBoss AS 5. I also have a servlet filter which intercepts all the requests to the server. Now, I want to redirect the users to the login page, if the session has expired. I need to do this &#x27;isSessionExpired()&#x27; check in the filter and need to redirect the user accordingly. How do I do it? I&#x27;m setting my session time limit in web.xml, as below:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
<session-config>
    <session-timeout>15</session-timeout>
</session-config>
```


## Original code snippet

You could use a Filter and do the following test:
The above code is untested.
This isn&#x27;t the most extensive solution however. You should also test that some domain-specific object or flag is available in the session before assuming that because a session isn&#x27;t new the user must&#x27;ve logged in. Be paranoid!

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);// don't create if it doesn't exist
if(session != null && !session.isNew()) {
    chain.doFilter(request, response);
} else {
    response.sendRedirect("/login.jsp");
}
```
