I am looking to use Java to get the MD5 checksum of a file.  I was really surprised but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that shows how to get the MD5 checksum of a file.
How is it done?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/304350

There&#x27;s an input stream decorator, java.security.DigestInputStream, so that you can compute the digest while using the input stream as you normally would, instead of having to make an extra pass over the data.

```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
try (InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(Paths.get("file.txt"));
     DigestInputStream dis = new DigestInputStream(is, md)) 
{
  /* Read decorated stream (dis) to EOF as normal... */
}
byte[] digest = md.digest();
```
