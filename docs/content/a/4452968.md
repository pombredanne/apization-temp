In Java, find if the first character in a string is upper case without using regular expressions.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4452968

Assuming s is non-empty:
or, as mentioned by divec, to make it work for characters with code points above U+FFFF:

```java
Character.isUpperCase(s.charAt(0))
Character.isUpperCase(s.codePointAt(0));
```
