I would like to know how to generate a random number between two given values.
I am able to generate a random number with the following:
However, how can I generate a random number between 0 and 100 (inclusive)?
Thank you all.


```java
Random r = new Random();

for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
    for(int j = 0; j < a[i].length; j++){
        a[i][j] = r.nextInt();
    }

}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5271613

You could use e.g. r.nextInt(101)
For a more generic &quot;in between two numbers&quot; use:
This gives you a random number in between 10 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive)

```java
Random r = new Random();
int Low = 10;
int High = 100;
int Result = r.nextInt(High-Low) + Low;
```
