Can you please help me understand what the following code means:

```java
x += 0.1;
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/7456548

The &quot;common knowledge&quot; of programming is that x += y is an equivalent shorthand notation of x = x + y. As long as x and y are of the same type (for example, both are ints), you may consider the two statements equivalent.
However, in Java, x += y is not identical to x = x + y in general.
If x and y are of different types, the behavior of the two statements differs due to the rules of the language. For example, let&#x27;s have x == 0 (int) and y == 1.1 (double):
+= performs an implicit cast, whereas for + you need to explicitly cast the second operand, otherwise you&#x27;d get a compiler error.
Quote from Joshua Bloch&#x27;s Java Puzzlers:
(...) compound assignment expressions automatically cast the result of
  the computation they perform  to the type of the variable on their
  left-hand side. If the type of the result is identical to the type of
  the variable, the cast has no effect. If, however, the type of the
  result is wider than that of the variable,  the  compound 
  assignment  operator  performs  a  silent  narrowing  primitive
  conversion [JLS 5.1.3].

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
int x = 0;
    x += 1.1;    // just fine; hidden cast, x == 1 after assignment
    x = x + 1.1; // won't compile! 'cannot convert from double to int'
```
