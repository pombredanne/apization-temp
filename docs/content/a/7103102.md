Calculating the Difference Between Two Java Date Instances
In Java, I want to calculate the number of days between two dates.
In my database they are stored as a DATE datatype, but in my code they are strings.
I want to calculate the no of days between those two strings.



## Original code snippet

Well to start with, you should only deal with them as strings when you have to. Most of the time you should work with them in a data type which actually describes the data you&#x27;re working with.
I would recommend that you use Joda Time, which is a much better API than Date/Calendar. It sounds like you should use the LocalDate type in this case. You can then use:

```java
int days = Days.daysBetween(date1, date2).getDays();
```
