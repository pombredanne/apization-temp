I am having a problem at a Java program. Exception in thread &quot;main&quot;
is the error that I&#x27;m getting. I could really use some help, since i am stuck hours on this spot...


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
java.lang.NullPointerException
at twoten.TwoTenB.<init>(TwoTenB.java:29)
at javapractice.JavaPractice.main(JavaPractice.java:32)
Java Result: 1
package twoten;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class TwoTenB {

public TwoTenB() {
    double percentage;
    double a[] = null;
    double total = 0;
    double var;
    System.out.print("\tRESULT\n\n");
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    //double[] mark = new double[7];
    for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {

        System.out.print("\nMarks in subject " + (i + 1) + "\t:\t");
        var = scan.nextDouble();

        a[i] = var;

        total = total + a[i];
       //percentage = first * second * third * fourth * fifth * sixth * seventh * 100 / 700;
    }

    percentage = total * 100 / 700;

    if (a[0] > 35 && a[1] > 35 && a[2] > 35 && a[3] > 35 && a[4] > 35 && a[5] > 35 && a[6] > 35 && percentage > 35) {
        if (percentage >= 60) {
            System.out.print("\nCongratulation!!! you've got FIRST dividion\n");
        } else if (percentage >= 45 && percentage < 60) {
            System.out.print("\nCongratulation!!! you've got SECOND dividion\n");
        } else if (percentage >= 35 && percentage < 45) {
            System.out.print("\nCongratulation!!! you've got THIRD dividion\n");
        }
    } else {
        System.out.print("\nSORRY!!! you've FAILED\n");
    }
    }

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/19467228

This is the problem
Since a is null, NullPointerException will arise every time you use it until you initialize it. So this:
will fail.
A possible solution would be initialize it when declaring it:
IMO more important than solving this exception, is the fact that you should learn to read the stacktrace and understand what it says, so you could detect the problems and solve it.
java.lang.NullPointerException
This exception means there&#x27;s a variable with null value being used. How to solve? Just make sure the variable is not null before being used.
at twoten.TwoTenB.(TwoTenB.java:29)
This line has two parts:
From this line, other lines will be similar to tell you where the error arose. So when reading this:
at javapractice.JavaPractice.main(JavaPractice.java:32)
It means that you were trying to instantiate a TwoTenB object reference inside the main method of your class JavaPractice declared in javapractice package.

```java
double a[] = null;
a[i] = var;
double a[] = new double[PUT_A_LENGTH_HERE]; //seems like this constant should be 7
```
