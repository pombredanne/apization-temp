I&#x27;m trying to test some legacy code, using Mockito.
I want to stub a FooDao that is used in production as follows:
I can write:
But the obvious problem is that getBar() is never called with the same Bazoo object that I stubbed the method for. (Curse that new operator!)
I would love it if I could stub the method in a way that it returns myFoo regardless of the argument. Failing that, I&#x27;ll listen to other workaround suggestions, but I&#x27;d really like to avoid changing the production code until there is reasonable test coverage.

```java
foo = fooDao.getBar(new Bazoo());
when(fooDao.getBar(new Bazoo())).thenReturn(myFoo);
```


## Original code snippet

or (to avoid nulls):
Don&#x27;t forget to import matchers (many others are available):
For Mockito 2.1.0 and newer:
For older versions:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
when(
  fooDao.getBar(
    any(Bazoo.class)
  )
).thenReturn(myFoo);
when(
  fooDao.getBar(
    (Bazoo)notNull()
  )
).thenReturn(myFoo);
import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.*;
import static org.mockito.Matchers.*;
```
