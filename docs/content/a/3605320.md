I have this HashMap that I need to print out in ascending order according to the values contained in it (not the keys).
But the order when I print it out is seemingly random.
What&#x27;s the best way to print it out in ascending value order?
In other words, the example above should print out as this:


```java
Map<String, String> codes = new HashMap<String, String>();

codes.put("A1", "Aania");
codes.put("X1", "Abatha");
codes.put("C1", "Acathan");
codes.put("S1", "Adreenas");
A1, Aania
X1, Abatha
C1, Acathan
S1, Adreenas
```

You aren&#x27;t going to be able to do this from the HashMap class alone.
I would take the Map&lt;String, String&gt; codes, construct a reverse map of TreeMap&lt;String, String&gt; reversedMap where you map the values of the codes Map to the keys (this would require your original Map to have a one-to-one mapping from key-to-value). Since the TreeMap provides Iterators which returns entries in ascending key order, this will give you the value/key combination of the first map in the order (sorted by values) you desire.
There are several collections libraries (commons-collections, Google Collections, etc) which have similar bidirectional Map implementations.

```java
Map<String, String> reversedMap = new TreeMap<String, String>(codes);

//then you just access the reversedMap however you like...
for (Map.Entry entry : reversedMap.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ", " + entry.getValue());
}
```
