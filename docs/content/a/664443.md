In Java, I&#x27;m dynamically creating a set of files and I&#x27;d like to change the file permissions on these files on a linux/unix file system.  I&#x27;d like to be able to execute the Java equivalent of chmod. Is that possible Java 5? If so, how?
I know in Java 6 the File object has setReadable()/setWritable() methods. I also know I could make a system call to do this, but I&#x27;d like to avoid that if possible.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/664443

Full control over file attributes is available in Java 7, as part of the &quot;new&quot; New IO facility (NIO.2). For example, POSIX permissions can be set with setPosixFilePermissions().
You can create a set of permissions using EnumSet.of(), but the helper method PosixFilePermissions.fromString() will uses a conventional format that will be more readable to many developers.
In earlier versions of Java, using native code of your own, or exec-ing command-line utilities are common approaches.
