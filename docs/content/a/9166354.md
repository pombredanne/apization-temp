I want to be able to call the following method after a specified delay.
 In objective c there was something like:
Is there an equivalent of this method in android with java?
For example I need to be able to call a method after 5 seconds.


```java
[self performSelector:@selector(DoSomething) withObject:nil afterDelay:5];
public void DoSomething()
{
     //do something here
}
```


## Original code snippet

Better version:

```java
final Handler handler = new Handler();
handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
  @Override
  public void run() {
    //Do something after 100ms
  }
}, 100);
```
