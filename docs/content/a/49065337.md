I&#x27;m looking for a simple commons method or operator that allows me to repeat some String n times. I know I could write this using a for loop, but I wish to avoid for loops whenever necessary and a simple direct method should exist somewhere.

I try to avoid for loops when they are not completely necessary because:
They add to the number of lines of code even if they are tucked away in another function.
Someone reading my code has to figure out what I am doing in that for loop. Even if it is commented and has meaningful variables names, they still have to make sure it is not doing anything &quot;clever&quot;.

```java
String str = "abc";
String repeated = str.repeat(3);

repeated.equals("abcabcabc");
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/49065337

From Java 11 on, there&#x27;s a method String::repeat that does exactly what you asked for:
Its Javadoc says:

```java
String str = "abc";
String repeated = str.repeat(3);
repeated.equals("abcabcabc");
/**
 * Returns a string whose value is the concatenation of this
 * string repeated {@code count} times.
 * <p>
 * If this string is empty or count is zero then the empty
 * string is returned.
 *
 * @param count number of times to repeat
 *
 * @return A string composed of this string repeated
 * {@code count} times or the empty string if this
 * string is empty or count is zero
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the {@code count} is
 * negative.
 *
 * @since 11
 */
```
