The Method request.getRequestURI() returns URI with context path.
For example, if the base URL of an application is http://localhost:8080/myapp/ (i.e. the context path is myapp), and I call request.getRequestURI() for http://localhost:8080/myapp/secure/users, it will return /myapp/secure/users.
Is there any way we can get only this part /secure/users, i.e. the URI without context path?



## Original code snippet

If you&#x27;re inside a front contoller servlet which is mapped on a prefix pattern, then you can just use HttpServletRequest#getPathInfo().
Assuming that the servlet in your example is mapped on /secure, then this will return /users which would be the information of sole interest inside a typical front controller servlet.
If the servlet is however mapped on a suffix pattern (your URL examples however does not indicate that this is the case), or when you&#x27;re actually inside a filter (when the to-be-invoked servlet is not necessarily determined yet, so getPathInfo() could return null), then your best bet is to substring the request URI yourself based on the context path&#x27;s length using the usual String method:

```java
String pathInfo = request.getPathInfo();
// ...
HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest) req;
String path = request.getRequestURI().substring(request.getContextPath().length());
// ...
```
