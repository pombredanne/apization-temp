Is there a clean method of mocking a class with generic parameters?  Say I have to mock a class Foo&lt;T&gt; which I need to pass into a method that expects a Foo&lt;Bar&gt;.  I can do the following easily enough:
Assuming getValue() returns the generic type T.  But that&#x27;s going to have kittens when I later pass it into a method expecting Foo&lt;Bar&gt;.  Is casting the only means of doing this?

```java
Foo mockFoo = mock(Foo.class);
when(mockFoo.getValue).thenReturn(new Bar());
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1652738

I think you do need to cast it, but it shouldn&#x27;t be too bad:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Foo<Bar> mockFoo = (Foo<Bar>) mock(Foo.class);
when(mockFoo.getValue).thenReturn(new Bar());
```
