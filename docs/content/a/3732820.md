I have  a string called CurrentString and is in the form of something like this
&quot;Fruit: they taste good&quot;. I would like to split up the CurrentString using the : as the delimiter.So that way the word &quot;Fruit&quot; will be split into its own string and &quot;they taste good&quot; will be another string.And then i would simply like to use SetText() of 2 different TextViews to display that string.
What would be the best way to approach this?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3732820

You may want to remove the space to the second String:
There are other ways to do it. For instance, you can use the StringTokenizer class (from java.util):

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String currentString = "Fruit: they taste good";
String[] separated = currentString.split(":");
separated[0]; // this will contain "Fruit"
separated[1]; // this will contain " they taste good"
separated[1] = separated[1].trim();
StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer(currentString, ":");
String first = tokens.nextToken();// this will contain "Fruit"
String second = tokens.nextToken();// this will contain " they taste good"
// in the case above I assumed the string has always that syntax (foo: bar)
// but you may want to check if there are tokens or not using the hasMoreTokens method
```
