I&#x27;m working on a game and I came across a little problem with my scanner.
I&#x27;m getting a resource leak scanner never closed.
But I thought my scanner was working before without closing it.
But now it ain&#x27;t. Anyone can help me out here?

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static final boolean CHEAT = true;

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int amountOfPlayers;
        do {
            System.out.print("Select the amount of players (1/2): ");
            while (!scanner.hasNextInt()) {
                System.out.println("That's not a number!");
                scanner.next(); // this is important!
        }

        amountOfPlayers = scanner.nextInt();
        while ((amountOfPlayers <= 0) || (amountOfPlayers > 2));
        System.out.println("You've selected " + amountOfPlayers+" player(s)."); 
    }
}

I am assuming you are using java 7, thus you get a compiler warning, when you don&#x27;t close the resource you should close your scanner usually in a finally block.
Or even better: use the new Try with resource statement:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Scanner scanner = null;
try {
    scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    //rest of the code
}
finally {
    if(scanner!=null)
        scanner.close();
}
try(Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)){
    //rest of your code
}
```
