With &quot;HTML&quot; Selenium tests (created with Selenium IDE or manually), you can use some very handy commands like WaitForElementPresent or WaitForVisible.
When coding Selenium tests in Java (Webdriver / Selenium RC—I&#x27;m not sure of the terminology here), is there something similar built-in?
For example, for checking that a dialog (that takes a while to open) is visible...
What&#x27;s the cleanest robust way to code such check?
Adding Thread.sleep() calls all over the place would be ugly and fragile, and rolling your own while loops seems pretty clumsy too...


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
<tr>
    <td>waitForElementPresent</td>
    <td>id=saveButton</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
WebElement dialog = driver.findElement(By.id("reportDialog"));
assertTrue(dialog.isDisplayed());  // often fails as it isn't visible *yet*
```


## Original code snippet

Implicit Wait
An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain
  amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are
  not immediately available. The default setting is 0. Once set, the
  implicit wait is set for the life of the WebDriver object instance.
Explicit Wait + Expected Conditions
An explicit waits is code you define to wait for a certain condition
  to occur before proceeding further in the code. The worst case of this
  is Thread.sleep(), which sets the condition to an exact time period to
  wait. There are some convenience methods provided that help you write
  code that will wait only as long as required. WebDriverWait in
  combination with ExpectedCondition is one way this can be
  accomplished.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
WebElement element = wait.until(
        ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("someid")));
```
