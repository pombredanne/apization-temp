I have a Date object in Java stored as Java&#x27;s Date type.
I also have a Gregorian Calendar created date. The gregorian calendar date has no parameters and therefore is an instance of today&#x27;s date (and time?).
With the java date, I want to be able to get the year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds from the java date type and compare the the gregoriancalendar date.
I saw that at the moment the Java date is stored as a long and the only methods available seem to just write the long as a formatted date string. Is there a way to access Year, month, day, etc?
I saw that the getYear(), getMonth(), etc. methods for Date class have been deprecated. I was wondering what&#x27;s the best practice to use the Java Date instance I have with the GregorianCalendar date.
My end goal is to do a date calculation so that I can check that the Java date is within so many hours, minutes etc of today&#x27;s date and time.
I&#x27;m still a newbie to Java and am getting a bit puzzled by this.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/9474172

Use something like:
Beware, months start at 0, not 1.
Edit: Since Java 8 it&#x27;s better to use java.time.LocalDate rather than java.util.Calendar. See this answer for how to do it.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Date date; // your date
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.setTime(date);
int year = cal.get(Calendar.YEAR);
int month = cal.get(Calendar.MONTH);
int day = cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
// etc.
```
