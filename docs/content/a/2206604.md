How can I cast a Java object into a boolean primitive
I tried like below but it doesn&#x27;t work
The constructor Boolean(Object) is undefined
Please advise.


```java
boolean di = new Boolean(someObject).booleanValue();
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2206604

If the object is actually a Boolean instance, then just cast it:
The explicit cast will do the conversion to Boolean, and then there&#x27;s the auto-unboxing to the primitive value. Or you can do that explicitly:
If someObject doesn&#x27;t refer to a Boolean value though, what do you want the code to do?

```java
boolean di = (Boolean) someObject;
boolean di = ((Boolean) someObject).booleanValue();
```
