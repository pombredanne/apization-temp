Using Selenium WebDriver with JAVA ,
I am trying to automate a functionality where I have to open a new tab do some operations there and come back to previous tab (Parent).
I used switch handle but its not working.
And one strange thing the two tabs are having same window handle due to which i am not able to switch between tabs.
However when I am trying with different Firefox windows it works, but for tab its not working.
Please help me how can i switch tabs.
OR how can I switch tabs without using window handle as window handle is same of both tabs in my case.
(I have observed that when you open different tabs in same window , window handle remains same.)



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/22944233

This code perfectly worked for me. Try it out. You always need to switch your driver to new tab, before you want to do something on new tab.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
psdbComponent.clickDocumentLink();
    ArrayList<String> tabs2 = new ArrayList<String> (driver.getWindowHandles());
    driver.switchTo().window(tabs2.get(1));
    driver.close();
    driver.switchTo().window(tabs2.get(0));
```
