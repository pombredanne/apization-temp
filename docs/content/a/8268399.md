Ello there,
I&#x27;m trying to assign the value of a javascript variable to a java variable. But I don&#x27;t have clue how to do this? Say for example I have this:


```java
<html>
<head>
   <script type="text/javascript">
       function return variable(){
          var a = "hello";
          return a;
       }
   </script>
</head>
<body>

<%
   //The java code
   String b = //how do I get that javascript variable here?
%>

</body>
</html>
```


## Original code snippet

Java script plays on browser where java code is server side thing so you can&#x27;t simply do this.
What you can do is submit the calculated variable from javascript to server by form-submission, or using URL parameter or using AJAX calls and then you can make it available on server
HTML
make sure this fields lays under &lt;form&gt;
Javascript
on server you would get this as a part of request

```java
<input type="hidden" id="hiddenField"/>
document.getElementById("hiddenField").value=yourCalculatedVariable;
```
