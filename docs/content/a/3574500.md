I am working on a web application in which data will be transfer between client &amp; server side.
I already know that JavaScript int != Java int. Because, Java int cannot be null, right. 
Now this is the problem I am facing.
I changed my Java int variables into Integer.
My problem is here:
I cant use the Integer variables here. I tried with intgerObject.intValue();
But it makes things more complex. Do we have any other conversion methods or conversion techniques?
Any fix would be better.


```java
public void aouEmployee(Employee employee) throws SQLException, ClassNotFoundException
{
   Integer tempID = employee.getId();
   String tname = employee.getName();
   Integer tage = employee.getAge();
   String tdept = employee.getDept();
   PreparedStatement pstmt;
   Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
   String url ="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/general";
   java.sql.Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,"root", "1234");
   System.out.println("URL: " + url);
   System.out.println("Connection: " + con);
   pstmt = (PreparedStatement) con.prepareStatement("REPLACE INTO PERSON SET ID=?, NAME=?, AGE=?, DEPT=?");
   pstmt.setInt(1, tempID);
   pstmt.setString(2, tname);
   pstmt.setInt(3, tage);
   pstmt.setString(4, tdept);
   pstmt.executeUpdate();
 }
pstmt.setInt(1, tempID);

pstmt.setInt(3, tage);
```

As already written elsewhere:
BUT as you wrote, an Integer can be null, so it&#x27;s wise to check that before trying to convert to int (or risk getting a NullPointerException).
or
* using a default of zero, could also do nothing, show a warning or ...
I mostly prefer not using autoboxing (second sample line) so it&#x27;s clear what I want to do.

```java
pstmt.setInt(1, (tempID != null ? tempID : 0));  // Java 1.5 or later
pstmt.setInt(1, (tempID != null ? tempID.intValue() : 0));  // any version, no autoboxing
```
