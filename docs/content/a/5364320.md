I am new to Java and for the time created an array of objects in Java.
I have a class A for example -
But this is only creating pointers (references) to A and not 4 objects. Is this correct? I see that when I try to access functions/variables in the objects created I get a null pointer exception.
To be able to manipulate/access the objects I had to do this --
Is this correct or am I doing something wrong? If this is correct its really odd.
EDIT: I find this odd because in C++ you just say new A[4] and it creates the four objects.

```java
A[] arr = new A[4];
A[] arr = new A[4];
for( int i=0; i<4; i++ )
    arr[i] = new A();
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5364320

This is correct.
creates 4 A references, similar to doing this
now you couldn&#x27;t do a1.someMethod() without allocating a1 as
similarly, with the array you need to do
before using it.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
A[] a = new A[4];
A a1;
A a2;
A a3;
A a4;
a1 = new A();
a[0] = new A();
```
