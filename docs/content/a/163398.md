I use RegexBuddy while working with regular expressions. From its library I copied the regular expression to match URLs. I tested successfully within RegexBuddy. However, when I copied it as Java String flavor and pasted it into Java code, it does not work. The following class prints false:
Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?


```java
public class RegexFoo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String regex = "\\b(https?|ftp|file)://[-A-Z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]";
        String text = "http://google.com";
        System.out.println(IsMatch(text,regex));
}

    private static boolean IsMatch(String s, String pattern) {
        try {
            Pattern patt = Pattern.compile(pattern);
            Matcher matcher = patt.matcher(s);
            return matcher.matches();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
        return false;
    }       
}   
}
```


## Original code snippet

Try the following regex string instead. Your test was probably done in a case-sensitive manner. I have added the lowercase alphas as well as a proper string beginning placeholder.
This works too:
Note:

```java
String regex = "^(https?|ftp|file)://[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]";
String regex = "\\b(https?|ftp|file)://[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]";
String regex = "<\\b(https?|ftp|file)://[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]>"; // matches <http://google.com>

String regex = "<^(https?|ftp|file)://[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]>"; // does not match <http://google.com>
```
