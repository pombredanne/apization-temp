I am using TreeBidiMap from the Apache Collections library. I want to sort this on the values which are doubles.
My method is to retrieve a Collection of the values using:
Which naturally works fine.
Main Question: I now want to know how I can convert/cast (not sure which is correct) coll into a List so it can be sorted?
I then intend to iterate over the sorted List object, which should be in order and get the appropriate keys from the TreeBidiMap (themap) using themap.getKey(iterator.next()) where the iterator will be over the list of doubles.


```java
Collection coll = themap.values();
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/580181

As Erel Segal Halevi says below, if coll is already a list, you can skip step one.  But that would depend on the internals of TreeBidiMap.

```java
List list = new ArrayList(coll);
Collections.sort(list);
List list;
if (coll instanceof List)
  list = (List)coll;
else
  list = new ArrayList(coll);
```
