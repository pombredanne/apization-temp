Is there any way I can get a list of all the running Threads in the current JVM (including the Threads NOT started by my class)?
Is it also possible to get the Thread and Class objects of all Thread in the list?
I want to be able to do this through code.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3018672

To get an iterable set:
To convert it to an array:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Set<Thread> threadSet = Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet();
Thread[] threadArray = threadSet.toArray(new Thread[threadSet.size()]);
```

## Produced APIzation

[`APIzator3018672.java`](https://github.com/pasqualesalza/apization-temp-data/raw/master/search/APIzator3018672.java)

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/apizator.png" /></div>

```java
package com.stackoverflow.api;

import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.javascript.host.Set;

/**

public class APIzator3018672 {

  public static Thread[] getList() throws RuntimeException {
    Set<Thread> threadSet = Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet();
    return threadSet.toArray(new Thread[threadSet.size()]);
  }
}
