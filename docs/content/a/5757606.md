I want to delete an object I created, (a oval which follows you), but how would I do this?
didn&#x27;t work.
EDIT:
Okay, I&#x27;ll give some more context. I&#x27;m making a small game with a oval you can control, and a oval which follows you. Now I&#x27;ve got files named: DrawPanel.class, this class draws everything on the screen, and handles collisions, sounds, etc. I got an enemy.class, which is the oval following the player. I got an entity.class, which is the player you can control. And if the player intersects with the follower, I want my player object to get deleted. The way I&#x27;m doing it:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
delete follower1;
public void checkCollisions(){
    if(player.getBounds().intersects(follower1.getBounds())){
        Follower1Alive = false;
        player.health = player.health - 10;
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

You should remove the references to it by assigning null or leaving the block where it was declared. After that, it will be automatically deleted by the garbage collector (not immediately, but eventually).
Example 1:
Example 2:
Not something that you are currently looking for, but FYI: you can invoke the garbage collector with the call System.gc()

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Object a = new Object();
a = null; // after this, if there is no reference to the object, it will be deleted by the garbage collector
if (something)
{
    Object o = new Object(); 
} // as you leave the block, the reference is deleted. Later on the garbage collector will delete he object itself.
```
