I have generated a secure random number, and put its value into a byte. Here is my code.
But I am getting an error :


```java
SecureRandom ranGen = new SecureRandom();
byte[] rno = new byte[4]; 
ranGen.nextBytes(rno);
int i = rno[0].intValue();
byte cannot be dereferenced
```

Your array is of byte primitives, but you&#x27;re trying to call a method on them.
You don&#x27;t need to do anything explicit to convert a byte to an int, just:
...since it&#x27;s not a downcast.
Just for completeness #1: If you did want to use the various methods of Byte for some reason (you don&#x27;t need to here), you could use a boxing conversion:
Or the Byte constructor:
But again, you don&#x27;t need that here.
Just for completeness #2: If it were a downcast (e.g., if you were trying to convert an int to a byte), all you need is a cast:
This assures the compiler that you know it&#x27;s a downcast, so you don&#x27;t get the &quot;Possible loss of precision&quot; error.

```java
int i=rno[0];
Byte b = rno[0]; // Boxing conversion converts `byte` to `Byte`
int i = b.intValue();
Byte b = new Byte(rno[0]);
int i = b.intValue();
int i;
byte b;

i = 5;
b = (byte)i;
```
