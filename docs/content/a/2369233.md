I heard from somebody that null == object is better than object == null  check
eg :
Is there any reasons or this is another myth ?
Thanks for help.


```java
void m1(Object obj ) {
   if(null == obj)  // Is this better than object == null ? Why ?
       return ;
   // Else blah blah
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2369233

This is probably a habit learned from C, to avoid this sort of typo (single = instead of a double ==):
The convention of putting the constant on the left side of == isn&#x27;t really useful in Java since Java requires that the expression in an if evaluate to a boolean value, so unless the constant is a boolean, you&#x27;d get a compilation error either way you put the arguments. (and if it is a boolean, you shouldn&#x27;t be using == anyway...)

```java
if (object = null) {
```
