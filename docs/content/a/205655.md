Given two absolute paths, e.g.
How can one create a relative path that uses the second path as its base? In the example above, the result should be: ./stuff/xyz.dat


```java
/var/data/stuff/xyz.dat
/var/data
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/205655

It&#x27;s a little roundabout, but why not use URI?  It has a relativize method which does all the necessary checks for you.
Please note that for file path there&#x27;s java.nio.file.Path#relativize since Java 1.7, as pointed out by @Jirka Meluzin in the other answer.

```java
String path = "/var/data/stuff/xyz.dat";
String base = "/var/data";
String relative = new File(base).toURI().relativize(new File(path).toURI()).getPath();
// relative == "stuff/xyz.dat"
```
