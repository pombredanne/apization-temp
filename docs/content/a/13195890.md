I want to delete all files inside ABC directory.
When I tried with FileUtils.deleteDirectory(new File(&quot;C:/test/ABC/&quot;)); it also deletes folder ABC.
Is there a one liner solution where I can delete files inside directory but not directory?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/13195890

There is this method available in the same file. This will also recursively deletes all sub-folders and files under them.
Docs: org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.cleanDirectory

```java
FileUtils.cleanDirectory(directory);
```
