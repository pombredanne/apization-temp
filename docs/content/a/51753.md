I was surprised to find today that I couldn&#x27;t track down any simple way to write the contents of an InputStream to an OutputStream in Java. Obviously, the byte buffer code isn&#x27;t difficult to write, but I suspect I&#x27;m just missing something which would make my life easier (and the code clearer).
So, given an InputStream in and an OutputStream out, is there a simpler way to write the following?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
int len = in.read(buffer);
while (len != -1) {
    out.write(buffer, 0, len);
    len = in.read(buffer);
}
```

As WMR mentioned, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils from Apache has a method called copy(InputStream,OutputStream) which does exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.
So, you have:
...in your code.
Is there a reason you&#x27;re avoiding IOUtils?

```java
InputStream in;
OutputStream out;
IOUtils.copy(in,out);
in.close();
out.close();
```
