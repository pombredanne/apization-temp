It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve done any Java so my syntax is not the greatest at the moment.
I want to check a char variable is one of 21 specific chars, what is the shortest way I can do this?
For example:
Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. Do I need to write it like:


```java
if(symbol == ('A'|'B'|'C')){}
if(symbol == 'A' || symbol == 'B' etc.)
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5034600

If your input is a character and the characters you are checking against are mostly consecutive you could try this:
However if your input is a string a more compact approach (but slower) is to use a regular expression with a character class:
If you have a character you&#x27;ll first need to convert it to a string before you can use a regular expression:

```java
if ((symbol >= 'A' && symbol <= 'Z') || symbol == '?') {
    // ...
}
if (symbol.matches("[A-Z?]")) {
    // ...
}
if (Character.toString(symbol).matches("[A-Z?]")) {
    // ...
}
```
