I would like to determine the operating system of the host that my Java program is running programmatically (for example: I would like to be able to load different properties based on whether I am on a Windows or Unix platform). What is the safest way to do this with 100% reliability?



## Original code snippet

You can use:
P.S. You may find this code useful:
All it does is print out all the properties provided by your Java implementations. It&#x27;ll give you an idea of what you can find out about your Java environment via properties. :-)

```java
System.getProperty("os.name")
class ShowProperties {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.getProperties().list(System.out);
    }
}
```
