In Java, I want to convert this:
To this:
This is what I have so far:
But it doesn&#x27;t work right.  What are these %3A and %2F formats called and how do I convert them?


```java
https%3A%2F%2Fmywebsite%2Fdocs%2Fenglish%2Fsite%2Fmybook.do%3Frequest_type
https://mywebsite/docs/english/site/mybook.do&request_type
class StringUTF 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        try{
            String url = 
               "https%3A%2F%2Fmywebsite%2Fdocs%2Fenglish%2Fsite%2Fmybook.do" +
               "%3Frequest_type%3D%26type%3Dprivate";

            System.out.println(url+"Hello World!------->" +
                new String(url.getBytes("UTF-8"),"ASCII"));
        }
        catch(Exception E){
        }
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

This does not have anything to do with character encodings such as UTF-8 or ASCII. The string you have there is URL encoded. This kind of encoding is something entirely different than character encoding.
Try something like this:
Note that a character encoding (such as UTF-8 or ASCII) is what determines the mapping of characters to raw bytes. For a good intro to character encodings, see this article.

```java
String result = java.net.URLDecoder.decode(url, "UTF-8");
```
