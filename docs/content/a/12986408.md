I am trying to sort an array of Strings using compareTo(). This is my code:
Now the output is:
I am getting results, but not the results I want to get, which are:
How can I adjust my code to sort the string array properly?


```java
static String Array[] = {" Hello ", " This ", "is ", "Sorting ", "Example"};
String temp;

public static void main(String[] args)
{

   for (int j=0; j<Array.length;j++)
   {
       for (int i=j+1 ; i<Array.length; i++)
       {
           if (Array[i].compareTo(Array[j])<0)
           {
               String temp = Array[j];
               Array[j] = Array[i];
               Array[i] = temp;
           }
       }
       System.out.print(Array[j]);
   }
}
Hello  This Example Sorting is
Hello This Example Is Sorting
```

Your output is correct. Denote the white characters of  &quot; Hello&quot; and &quot; This&quot; at the beginning.
Another issue is with your methodology. Use the Arrays.sort() method:
Output:
Here the third element of the array &quot;is&quot; should be &quot;Is&quot;, otherwise it will come in last after sorting. Because the sort method internally uses the ASCII value to sort elements.

```java
String[] strings = { " Hello ", " This ", "Is ", "Sorting ", "Example" };
Arrays.sort(strings);
Hello
 This
Example
Is
Sorting
```
