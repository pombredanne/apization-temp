How do I get the id of my Java process?
I know there are several platform-dependent hacks, but I would prefer a more generic solution.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/35885

There exists no platform-independent way that can be guaranteed to work in all jvm implementations.
ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName() looks like the best (closest) solution. It&#x27;s short, and probably works in every implementation in wide use.
On linux+windows it returns a value like 12345@hostname (12345 being the process id). Beware though that according to the docs, there are no guarantees about this value:
Returns the name representing the running Java virtual machine. The
  returned name string can be any arbitrary string and a Java virtual
  machine implementation can choose to embed platform-specific useful
  information in the returned name string. Each running virtual machine
  could have a different name.
In Java 9 the new process API can be used:

```java
long pid = ProcessHandle.current().pid();
```
