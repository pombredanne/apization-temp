I am trying to figure out how to pass multiple parameters in a URL. I want to pass latitude and longitude from my android class to a java servlet. How can I do that?
In this case output (written to file) is 28.53438677.472097.
This is working but I want to pass latitude and longitude in two separate parameters so that my work at server side is reduced. If it is not possible how can I at least add a space between lat &amp; lon so that I can use tokenizer class to get my latitude and longitude. I tried following line but to no avail.
My servlet code is as follows:
Also I wanted to the know is this the most safe and secured way to pass the data from android device to server.


```java
URL url;
double lat=touchedPoint.getLatitudeE6() / 1E6;
double lon=touchedPoint.getLongitudeE6() / 1E6;
url = new URL("http://10.0.2.2:8080/HelloServlet/PDRS?param1="+lat+lon);
url = new URL("http://10.0.2.2:8080/HelloServlet/PDRS?param1="+lat+" "+lon);
output- Nothing is written to file
        url = new URL("http://10.0.2.2:8080/HelloServlet/PDRS?param1="+lat+"&?param2="+lon);
output- 28.534386 (Only Latitude)
        url = new URL("http://10.0.2.2:8080/HelloServlet/PDRS?param1="+lat+"?param2="+lon);
output- 28.532577?param2=77.502996
req.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
resp.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
final String par1 =  req.getParameter("param1");
final String par2 = req.getParameter("param2");
FileWriter fstream = new FileWriter("C:\\Users\\Hitchhiker\\Desktop\\out2.txt");
BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(fstream);
out.write(par1);
out.append(par2);
out.close();
```

This
must work. For whatever strange reason1, you need ? before the first parameter and &amp; before the following ones.
Using a compound parameter like
would work, too, but is surely not nice. You can&#x27;t use a space there as it&#x27;s prohibited in an URL, but you could encode it as %20 or + (but this is even worse style).
1 Stating that ? separates the path and the parameters and that &amp; separates parameters from each other does not explain anything about the reason. Some RFC says &quot;use ? there and &amp; there&quot;, but I can&#x27;t see why they didn&#x27;t choose the same character.

```java
url = new URL("http://10.0.2.2:8080/HelloServlet/PDRS?param1="+lat+"&param2="+lon);
url = new URL("http://10.0.2.2:8080/HelloServlet/PDRS?param1="+lat+"_"+lon);
```
