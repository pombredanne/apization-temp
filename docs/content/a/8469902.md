What I am trying to do is have multiple inputs that all have different variables. Each variable will be part of different equations. I am looking for a way to do this and, I think I have an idea. I just want to know if this would be legal and, if maybe there is a better way to do this.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Example{

public static void main(String args[]){

    Scanner dd = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.println("Enter number.");
    int a = dd.nextInt();
    System.out.println("Enter number.");
    int b = dd.nextInt();
    System.out.println("Enter number.");
    int c = dd.nextInt();
  }
}

If every input asks the same question, you should use a for loop and an array of inputs:
Or as Chip suggested, you can parse the input from one line:
You were on the right track, and what you did works. This is just a nicer and more flexible way of doing things.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Scanner dd = new Scanner(System.in);
int[] vars = new int[3];

for(int i = 0; i < vars.length; i++) {
  System.out.println("Enter next var: ");
  vars[i] = dd.nextInt();
}
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int[] vars = new int[3];

System.out.println("Enter "+vars.length+" vars: ");
for(int i = 0; i < vars.length; i++)
  vars[i] = in.nextInt();
```
