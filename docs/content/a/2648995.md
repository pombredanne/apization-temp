I need to log URLs that are linking to my site in a Java Servlet.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2648995

It&#x27;s available in the HTTP referer header. You can get it in a servlet as follows:
You however need to realize that this is a client-controlled value and can thus be spoofed to something entirely different or even removed. Thus, whatever value it returns, you should not use it for any critical business processes in the backend, but only for presentation control (e.g. hiding/showing/changing certain pure layout parts) and/or statistics.
For the interested, background about the misspelling can be found in Wikipedia.
