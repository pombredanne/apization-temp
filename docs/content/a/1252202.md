What is a way to simply wait for all threaded process to finish?  For example, let&#x27;s say I have:
How do I alter this so the main() method pauses at the comment until all threads&#x27; run() methods exit? Thanks!


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public class DoSomethingInAThread implements Runnable{

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int n=0; n<1000; n++) {
            Thread t = new Thread(new DoSomethingInAThread());
            t.start();
        }
        // wait for all threads' run() methods to complete before continuing
    }

    public void run() {
        // do something here
    }


}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/1252202

You put all threads in an array, start them all, and then have a loop
Each join will block until the respective thread has completed. Threads may complete in a different order than you joining them, but that&#x27;s not a problem: when the loop exits, all threads are completed.

```java
for(i = 0; i < threads.length; i++)
  threads[i].join();
```
