I&#x27;m trying to get an event to fire whenever a choice is made from a JComboBox.
The problem I&#x27;m having is that there is no obvious addSelectionListener() method.
I&#x27;ve tried to use actionPerformed() but it never fires.
Short of overriding the model for the JComboBox I&#x27;m out of ideas.
How do I get notified of a selection change on a JComboBox?
Edit: I have to apologize it turns out I was using a misbehaving subclass of JComboBox, but I&#x27;ll leave the question up since your answer is good.  Commence the vote down. :)



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/58963

It should respond to ActionListeners, like this:
@John Calsbeek rightly points out that addItemListener() will work, too.  You may get 2 ItemEvents, though, one for the deselection of the previously selected item, and another for the selection of the new item. Just don&#x27;t use both event types!

```java
combo.addActionListener (new ActionListener () {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        doSomething();
    }
});
