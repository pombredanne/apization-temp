What&#x27;s the best framework for creating mock objects in Java? Why? What are the pros and cons of each framework?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/23048

I&#x27;ve had good success using Mockito.
When I tried learning about JMock and EasyMock, I found the learning curve to be a bit steep (though maybe that&#x27;s just me).
I like Mockito because of its simple and clean syntax that I was able to grasp pretty quickly. The minimal syntax is designed to support the common cases very well, although the few times I needed to do something more complicated I found what I wanted was supported and easy to grasp.
Here&#x27;s an (abridged) example from the Mockito homepage:
It doesn&#x27;t get much simpler than that.
The only major downside I can think of is that it won&#x27;t mock static methods.

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

List mockedList = mock(List.class);
mockedList.clear();
verify(mockedList).clear();
```
