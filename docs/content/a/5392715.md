I need to genarate a random number with exactly 6 digits in Java. I know i could loop 6 times over a randomicer but is there a nother way to do this in the standard Java SE ?

```java
protected String createRandomRegistryId(String handleId)
{
    // syntax we would like to generate is DIA123456-A1B34      
    String val = "DI";      

    // char (1), random A-Z
    int ranChar = 65 + (new Random()).nextInt(90-65);
    char ch = (char)ranChar;        
    val += ch;      

    // numbers (6), random 0-9
    Random r = new Random();
    int numbers = 100000 + (int)(r.nextFloat() * 899900);
    val += String.valueOf(numbers);

    val += "-";
    // char or numbers (5), random 0-9 A-Z
    for(int i = 0; i<6;){
        int ranAny = 48 + (new Random()).nextInt(90-65);

        if(!(57 < ranAny && ranAny<= 65)){
        char c = (char)ranAny;      
        val += c;
        i++;
        }

    }

    return val;
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5392715

Generate a number in the range from 100000 to 999999.
I’m pretty sure you have already read the documentation for e.g. Random and can figure out the rest yourself.

```java
// pseudo code
int n = 100000 + random_float() * 900000;
```
