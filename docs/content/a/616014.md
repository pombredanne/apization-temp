In my Java application, I want to run a batch file that calls &quot;scons -Q implicit-deps-changed build\file_load_type export\file_load_type&quot;
It seems that I can&#x27;t even get my batch file to execute. I&#x27;m out of ideas.
This is what I have in Java:
Previously, I had a Python Sconscript file that I wanted to run but since that didn&#x27;t work I decided I would call the script via a batch file but that method has not been successful as of yet.

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/616014

Batch files are not an executable.  They need an application to run them (i.e. cmd).
On UNIX, the script file has shebang (#!) at the start of a file to specify the program that executes it.  Double-clicking in Windows is performed by Windows Explorer.  CreateProcess does not know anything about that.
Note: With the start \&quot;\&quot; command, a separate command window will be opened with a blank title and any output from the batch file will be displayed there.  It should also work with just `cmd /c build.bat&quot;, in which case the output can be read from the sub-process in Java if desired.
