What is the difference between an object, instance, and reference? They say that they have to create an instance to their application? What does that mean?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5126096

An object and an instance are the same thing.
Personally I prefer to use the word &quot;instance&quot; when referring to a specific object of a specific type, for example &quot;an instance of type Foo&quot;. But when talking about objects in general I would say &quot;objects&quot; rather than &quot;instances&quot;.
A reference either refers to a specific object or else it can be a null reference.
They say that they have to create an instance to their application. What does it mean?
They probably mean you have to write something like this:
If you are unsure what type you should instantiate you should contact the developers of the application and ask for a more complete example.

```java
Foo foo = new Foo();
```
