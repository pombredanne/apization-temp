I want to read a file from a java web application. I don&#x27;t want to give the absolute path of the file. I just want to put the file in some directory of my web application.
Or
It can be placed along with .war file (packaged web application).
What relative path to give for the file. I tried ./filename.csv but it didn&#x27;t work.
========Updated========

## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2395824

Do you really need to load it from a file? If you place it along your classes (in WEB-INF/classes) you can get an InputStream to it using the class loader:

```java
InputStream csv = 
   SomeClassInTheSamePackage.class.getResourceAsStream("filename.csv");
```
