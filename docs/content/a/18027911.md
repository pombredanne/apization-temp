So I am using Eclipse with Windows builder. I was just wondering if there was anyway I can import an image that&#x27;ll show up on the JFrame that I can easily move around and re-size instead of setting the location and size and drawing it.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/18027911

There is no specialized image component provided in Swing (which is sad in my opinion). So, there are a few options:
Create in the window builder a JPanel, that will represent the location of the image. Then add your own custom image component to the JPanel using a few lines of code you will never have to change. They should look like this:
where JImageComponent is a self created class that extends JComponent that overrides the paintComponent() method to draw the image.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
JImageComponent ic = new JImageComponent(myImageGoesHere);
imagePanel.add(ic);
```
