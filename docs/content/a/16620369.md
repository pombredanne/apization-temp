What is the difference between a null string (String s = null) and an empty string (String s = &quot;&quot;)?
This is what I have:
What does it mean?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String s1 = ""; //print statement does not print any thing for s1 but s1.length()=0
String s2 = null;//print statement prints "null" for s2  but s2.length() gives exception
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/16620369

String s1 = &quot;&quot;; means that the empty String is assigned to s1.
In this case, s1.length() is the same as &quot;&quot;.length(), which will yield 0 as expected.
String s2 = null; means that (null) or &quot;no value at all&quot; is assigned to s2.  So this one, s2.length() is the same as null.length(), which will yield a NullPointerException as you can&#x27;t call methods on null variables (pointers, sort of) in Java.
Also, a point, the statement
Actually has the same effect as:
Whereas
Is, as said, a different thing.

```java
String s1;
String s1 = null;
String s1 = "";
```
