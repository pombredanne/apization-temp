I have a poorly designed class in a 3rd-party JAR and I need to access one of its private fields. For example,
why should I need to choose private field is it necessary?
How can I use reflection to get the value of stuffIWant?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
class IWasDesignedPoorly {
    private Hashtable stuffIWant;
}

IWasDesignedPoorly obj = ...;
```


## Original code snippet

In order to access private fields, you need to get them from the class&#x27;s declared fields and then make them accessible:
EDIT: as has been commented by aperkins, both accessing the field, setting it as accessible and retrieving the value will all throw Exceptions, although the only checked exceptions you need to be mindful of are commented above.
The NoSuchFieldException would be thrown if you asked for a field by a name which did not correspond to a declared field.
The IllegalAccessException would be thrown if the field was not accessible (for example, if it is private and has not been made accessible via missing out the f.setAccessible(true) line.
The RuntimeExceptions which may be thrown are either SecurityExceptions (if the JVM&#x27;s SecurityManager will not allow you to change a field&#x27;s accessibility), or IllegalArgumentExceptions, if you try and access the field on an object not of the field&#x27;s class&#x27;s type:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
Field f = obj.getClass().getDeclaredField("stuffIWant"); //NoSuchFieldException
f.setAccessible(true);
Hashtable iWantThis = (Hashtable) f.get(obj); //IllegalAccessException
obj.getClass().getDeclaredField("misspelled"); //will throw NoSuchFieldException
f.get("BOB"); //will throw IllegalArgumentException, as String is of the wrong type
```
