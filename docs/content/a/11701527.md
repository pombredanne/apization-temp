I have read a lot of stackoverflow questions but none seems to be working for me. i am using math.round() to round off.
this is the code:
the output i get is: 123 but i want it to be 123.14. i read that adding *100/100 will help but as you can see i didn&#x27;t manage to get it to work.
it is absolutely essential for both input and output to be a double.
it would be great great help if you change the line 4 of the code above and post it.


```java
class round{
    public static void main(String args[]){

    double a = 123.13698;
    double roundOff = Math.round(a*100)/100;

    System.out.println(roundOff);
}
}
```

Well this one works...
Output is
Or as @Rufein said
this will do it for you as well.

```java
double roundOff = Math.round(a * 100.0) / 100.0;
123.14
double roundOff = (double) Math.round(a * 100) / 100;
```
