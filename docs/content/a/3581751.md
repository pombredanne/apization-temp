I know we can use the charAt() method in Java get an individual character in a string by specifying its position. Is there an equivalent method in C#?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3581751

You can index into a string in C# like an array, and you get the character at that index.
Example:
In Java, you would say
In C#, you would say

```java
str.charAt(8);
str[8];
```
