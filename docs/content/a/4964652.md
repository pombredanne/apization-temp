I&#x27;m trying to read from a text/plain file over the internet, line-by-line. The code I have right now is:
The file, test.txt, contains ¡Hélló!, which I am using in order to test the encoding.
When I review the OutputStream (out), I see it as &gt; ¬°H√©ll√≥!. I don&#x27;t believe this is a problem with the OutputStream since I can do out.println(&quot;é&quot;); without problems.
Any ideas for reading form the InputStream as UTF-8? Thanks!


```java
URL url = new URL("http://kuehldesign.net/test.txt");
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream()));
LinkedList<String> lines = new LinkedList();
String readLine;

while ((readLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
    lines.add(readLine);
}

for (String line : lines) {
    out.println("> " + line);
}
```

Solved my own problem. This line:
needs to be:
or since Java 7:

```java
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream()));
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream(), "UTF-8"));
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```
