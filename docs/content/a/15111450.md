In Java for String class there is a method called matches, how to use this method to check if my string is having only digits using regular expression. I tried with below examples, but both of them returned me false as result.


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String regex = "[0-9]";
String data = "23343453";
System.out.println(data.matches(regex));
String regex = "^[0-9]";
String data = "23343453";
System.out.println(data.matches(regex));
```


## Original code snippet

Try
or
As per Java regular expressions, the  + means &quot;one or more times&quot; and \d means &quot;a digit&quot;.
Note: the &quot;double backslash&quot; is an escape sequence to get a single backslash - therefore, \\d in a java String gives you the actual result: \d

Firstly, if you are in doubt about the correctness of this solution (or others), please run this test case:
Question 1: Isn&#x27;t it necessary to add ^ and $ to the regex, so it won&#x27;t match &quot;aa123bb&quot; ?
No. In java, the matches method (which was specified in the question) matches a complete string, not fragments. In other words, it is not necessary to use ^\\d+$ (even though it is also correct). Please see the last negative test case.
Please note that if you use an online &quot;regex checker&quot; then this may behave differently. To match fragments of a string in Java, you can use the find method instead, described in detail here:

Question 2: Won&#x27;t this regex also match the empty string, &quot;&quot; ?
No. A regex \\d* would match the empty string, but \\d+ does not. The star * means zero or more, whereas the plus + means one or more. Please see the first negative test case.
Question 3: Isn&#x27;t it faster to compile a regex Pattern?
Yes. It is indeed faster to compile a regex Pattern once, rather than on every invocation of matches, and so if performance implications are important then a Pattern can be compiled and used like this:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String regex = "[0-9]+";
String regex = "\\d+";
String regex = "\\d+";

// positive test cases, should all be "true"
System.out.println("1".matches(regex));
System.out.println("12345".matches(regex));
System.out.println("123456789".matches(regex));

// negative test cases, should all be "false"
System.out.println("".matches(regex));
System.out.println("foo".matches(regex));
System.out.println("aa123bb".matches(regex));
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
System.out.println(pattern.matcher("1").matches());
System.out.println(pattern.matcher("12345").matches());
System.out.println(pattern.matcher("123456789").matches());
```
