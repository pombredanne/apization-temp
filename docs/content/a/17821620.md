I have a problem resetting hours in Java. For a given date I want to set the hours to 00:00:00.
This is my code :
The problem is that sometimes the time is 12:00:00 and sometimes it is 00:00:00 and when I query the database for an entity that was saved on 07.02.2013 00:00:00 and the actual entity time, that is stored, is 12:00:00 the query fails.
I know that 12:00:00 == 00:00:00!
I am using AppEngine. Is this an appengine bug, problem or some other issue?  Or does it depend on something else?

```java
/**
     * Resets milliseconds, seconds, minutes and hours from the provided date
     *
     * @param date
     * @return
     */
    public static Date trim(Date date) {
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.setTime(date);
        calendar.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0);
        calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);
        calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0);
        calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR, 0);

        return calendar.getTime();
    }
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/17821620

Use another constant instead of Calendar.HOUR, use Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY.
Calendar.HOUR uses 0-11 (for use with AM/PM), and Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY uses 0-23.
To quote the Javadocs:
public static final int HOUR
Field number for get and set indicating
  the hour of the morning or afternoon. HOUR is used for the 12-hour
  clock (0 - 11). Noon and midnight are represented by 0, not by 12.
  E.g., at 10:04:15.250 PM the HOUR is 10.
and
public static final int HOUR_OF_DAY
Field number for get and set
  indicating the hour of the day. HOUR_OF_DAY is used for the 24-hour
  clock. E.g., at 10:04:15.250 PM the HOUR_OF_DAY is 22.
Testing (&quot;now&quot; is currently c. 14:55 on July 23, 2013 Pacific Daylight Time):
Output:

        now.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0);
        now.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);
        System.out.println(sdf.format(now.getTime()));
        now.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0);
