i would like to do dynamic casting for a java variable, the casting type is stored in a different variable.
this is regular casting:
this is what i want:
is it possible? and if so how? thanks!
I&#x27;m trying to populate a class with a hashMap that i received.
this is the constructor:
the problem here is that some of the classes variables are Double type, and if the number 3 is received it sees it as Integer and i have type problem.


```java
String a = (String) 5;
String theType = 'String';
 String a = (theType) 5;
public ConnectParams(HashMap<String,Object> obj) {

    for (Map.Entry<String, Object> entry : obj.entrySet()) {
        try {
            Field f =  this.getClass().getField(entry.getKey());                
            f.set(this, entry.getValue()); /* <= CASTING PROBLEM */
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException ex) {
            log.error("did not find field '" + entry.getKey() + '"');
        } catch (IllegalAccessException ex) {
            log.error(ex.getMessage());         
        }
    }

}
```

Regarding your update, the only way to solve this in Java is to write code that covers all cases with lots of if and else and instanceof expressions. What you attempt to do  looks as if are used to program with dynamic languages. In static languages, what you attempt to do is almost impossible and one would probably choose a totally different approach for what you attempt to do. Static languages are just not as flexible as dynamic ones :)

That does not make sense, in
the type of a is statically bound to be String so it does not make any sense to have a dynamic cast to this static type.
PS: The first line of your example could be written as Class&lt;String&gt; stringClass = String.class; but still, you cannot use stringClass to cast variables.

```java
String a = (theType) 5;
```
