I&#x27;m trying to read a text file line by line using InputStream from the assets directory in Android.
I want to convert the InputStream to a BufferedReader to be able to use the readLine().
I have the following code:
The third line drops the following error:
What I&#x27;m trying to do in C would be something like:
What am I doing wrong or how should I do that? Thanks!


```java
InputStream is;
is = myContext.getAssets().open ("file.txt");
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader (is);
StreamReader file;
file = File.OpenText ("file.txt");

line = file.ReadLine();
line = file.ReadLine();
...
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5200207

BufferedReader can&#x27;t wrap an InputStream directly. It wraps another Reader. In this case you&#x27;d want to do something like:

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, "UTF-8"));
```
