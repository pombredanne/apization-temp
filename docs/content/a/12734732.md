I have a sentence that is passed in as a string and I am doing a replace on the word &quot;and&quot; and I want to replace it with &quot; &quot;.  And it&#x27;s not replacing the word &quot;and&quot; with white space.  Below is an example of my logic.  And when I debug this the logic does fall into the sentence.replace.
Is there something I am missing here.


```java
String sentence = "Define, Measure, Analyze, Design and Verify"
if (sentence.contains("and")){
    sentence.replace("and", " ");
}
```

And when I debug this the logic does fall into the sentence.replace.
Yes, and then you discard the return value.
Strings in Java are immutable - when you call replace, it doesn&#x27;t change the contents of the existing string - it returns a new string with the modifications. So you want:
This applies to all the methods in String (substring, toLowerCase etc). None of them change the contents of the string.
Note that you don&#x27;t really need to do this in a condition - after all, if the sentence doesn&#x27;t contain &quot;and&quot;, it does no harm to perform the replacement:

```java
sentence = sentence.replace("and", " ");
String sentence = "Define, Measure, Analyze, Design and Verify";
sentence = sentence.replace("and", " ");
```
