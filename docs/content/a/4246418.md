I want to draw random coloured points on a JPanel in a Java application. Is there any method to create random colours?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4246418

Use the random library:
Then create a random generator:
As colours are separated into red green and blue, you can create a new random colour by creating random primary colours:
Then to finally create the colour, pass the primary colours into the constructor:
You can also create different random effects using this method, such as creating random colours with more emphasis on certain colours ... pass in less green and blue to produce a &quot;pinker&quot; random colour.
Or to ensure that only &quot;light&quot; colours are generated, you can generate colours that are always &gt; 0.5 of each colour element:
There are various other colour functions that can be used with the Color class, such as making the colour brighter:
An overview of the Color class can be read here: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html

```java
import java.util.Random;
Random rand = new Random();
// Java 'Color' class takes 3 floats, from 0 to 1.
float r = rand.nextFloat();
float g = rand.nextFloat();
float b = rand.nextFloat();
Color randomColor = new Color(r, g, b);
// Will produce a random colour with more red in it (usually "pink-ish")
float r = rand.nextFloat();
float g = rand.nextFloat() / 2f;
float b = rand.nextFloat() / 2f;
// Will produce only bright / light colours:
float r = rand.nextFloat() / 2f + 0.5;
float g = rand.nextFloat() / 2f + 0.5;
float b = rand.nextFloat() / 2f + 0.5;
randomColor.brighter();
```
