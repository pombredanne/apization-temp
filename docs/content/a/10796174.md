The Java official documentation states:
The string &quot;boo:and:foo&quot;, for example, yields the following results with these expressions 
Regex   Result
:
And that&#x27;s the way I need it to work. However, if I run this:
it prints:
Which is far from what I would expect:
Why is this happening?


```java
{ "boo", "and", "foo" }"
public static void main(String[] args){
        String test = "A|B|C||D";

        String[] result = test.split("|");

        for(String s : result){
            System.out.println(">"+s+"<");
        }
    }

>A<
>|<
>B<
>|<
>C<
>|<
>|<
>D<
>A<
>B<
>C<
><
>D<
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/10796174

You need
split uses regular expression and in regex | is a metacharacter representing the OR operator. You need to escape that character using \ (written in String as &quot;\\&quot; since \ is also a metacharacter in String literals and require another \ to escape it).
You can also use
and let Pattern.quote create the escaped version of the regex representing |.

```java
test.split("\\|");
test.split(Pattern.quote("|"));
```
