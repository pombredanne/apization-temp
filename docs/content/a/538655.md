I&#x27;m trying to access an XML file within a jar file, from a separate jar that&#x27;s running as a desktop application.  I can get the URL to the file I need, but when I pass that to a FileReader (as a String) I get a FileNotFoundException saying &quot;The file name, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.&quot;
As a point of reference, I have no trouble reading image resources from the same jar, passing the URL to an ImageIcon constructor.  This seems to indicate that the method I&#x27;m using to get the URL is correct.
Inside the ServicesLoader class I have
What&#x27;s wrong with using this technique to read the XML file?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
URL url = getClass().getResource("/xxx/xxx/xxx/services.xml");
ServicesLoader jsl = new ServicesLoader( url.toString() );
XMLReader xr = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
xr.setContentHandler( this );
xr.setErrorHandler( this );
xr.parse( new InputSource( new FileReader( filename )));
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/538655

The problem was that I was going a step too far in calling the parse method of XMLReader. The parse method accepts an InputSource, so there was no reason to even use a FileReader. Changing the last line of the code above to
works just fine.

```java
xr.parse( new InputSource( filename ));
```
