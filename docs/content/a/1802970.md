I did check the other questions; this question has its focus on solving this particular question the most efficient way.
Sometimes you want to create a new string with a specified length, and with a default character filling the entire string.
ie, it would be cool if you could do new String(10, &#x27;*&#x27;) and create a new String from there, with a length of 10 characters all having a *.
Because such a constructor does not exist, and you cannot extend from String, you have either to create a wrapper class or a method to do this for you.
At this moment I am using this:
It still lacks any checking (ie, when length is 0 it will not work). I am constructing the array first because I believe it is faster than using string concatination or using a StringBuffer to do so.
Anyone else has a better sollution?

```java
protected String getStringWithLengthAndFilledWithCharacter(int length, char charToFill) {
    char[] array = new char[length];
    int pos = 0;
    while (pos < length) {
        array[pos] = charToFill;
        pos++;
    }
    return new String(array);
}
```


## Original code snippet

Apache Commons Lang (probably useful enough to be on the classpath of any non-trivial project) has StringUtils.repeat():
Easy!

```java
String filled = StringUtils.repeat("*", 10);
```
