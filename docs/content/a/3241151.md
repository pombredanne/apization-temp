I&#x27;m pretty new to Java and am following the Eclipse Total Beginner&#x27;s Tutorials. They are all very helpful, but in Lesson 12, he uses assertTrue for one test case and assertFalse for another. Here&#x27;s the code:
I have searched for good documentation on these methods, but haven&#x27;t found anything. If my understanding is correct, assertTrue as well as assertFalse display the string when the second parameter evaluates to false. If so, what is the point of having both of them?

```java
// Check the book out to p1 (Thomas)
// Check to see that the book was successfully checked out to p1 (Thomas)
assertTrue("Book did not check out correctly", ml.checkOut(b1, p1));    // If checkOut fails, display message
assertEquals("Thomas", b1.getPerson().getName());

assertFalse("Book was already checked out", ml.checkOut(b1,p2));        // If checkOut fails, display message
assertEquals("Book was already checked out", m1.checkOut(b1,p2));
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3241151

assertTrue will fail if the second parameter evaluates to false (in other words, it ensures that the value is true).  assertFalse does the opposite.
As with many other things, the best way to become familiar with these methods is to just experiment :-).

```java
assertTrue("This will succeed.", true);
assertTrue("This will fail!", false);

assertFalse("This will succeed.", false);
assertFalse("This will fail!", true);
```
