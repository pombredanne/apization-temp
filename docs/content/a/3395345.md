When you have to loop through a collection and make a string of each data separated by a delimiter, you always end up with an extra delimiter at the end, e.g.
Gives something like : serverId_1, serverId_2, serverId_3,
I would like to delete the last character in the StringBuilder (without converting it because I still need it after this loop).

```java
for(String serverId : serverIds) {
 sb.append(serverId);
 sb.append(",");
}
```


## Original code snippet

Others have pointed out the deleteCharAt method, but here&#x27;s another alternative approach:
Alternatively, use the Joiner class from Guava :)
As of Java 8, StringJoiner is part of the standard JRE.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
String prefix = "";
for (String serverId : serverIds) {
  sb.append(prefix);
  prefix = ",";
  sb.append(serverId);
}
```
