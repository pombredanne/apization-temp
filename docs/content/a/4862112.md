I am having a problem with the following lines where car is a String array which has not been initialized/has no elements.
What is a possible solution?


```java
String car [];
System.out.println(car.length);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4862112

Since car has not been initialized, it has no length, its value is null. However, the compiler won&#x27;t even allow you to compile that code as is, throwing the following error: variable car might not have been initialized.
You need to initialize it first, and then you can use .length:
If you need to initialize an empty array, you can use the following:
If you need to initialize it with a specific size, in order to fill certain positions, you can use the following:
However, I&#x27;d recommend that you use a List instead, if you intend to add elements to it:

```java
String car[] = new String[] { "BMW", "Bentley" };
System.out.println(car.length);
String car[] = new String[] { }; // or simply String car[] = { };
System.out.println(car.length);
String car[] = new String[3]; // initialize a String[] with length 3
System.out.println(car.length); // 3
car[0] = "BMW";
System.out.println(car.length); // 3
List<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
System.out.println(cars.size()); // 0
cars.add("BMW");
System.out.println(cars.size()); // 1
```
