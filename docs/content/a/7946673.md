In my current program one method asks the user to enter the description of a product as a String input. However, when I later attempt to print out this information, only the first word of the String shows. What could be the cause of this? My method is as follows:
So if the user input is &quot;Sparkling soda with orange flavor&quot;, the System.out.print will only yield &quot;Sparkling&quot;.
Any help will be greatly appreciated!


```java
void setDescription(Product aProduct) {
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Describe the product: ");
    String productDescription = input.next();
    aProduct.description = productDescription;
}
```


## Original code snippet

Replace next() with nextLine():

```java
String productDescription = input.nextLine();
```
