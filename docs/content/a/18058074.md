I want to write a simple regular expression to check if in given string exist any special character. My regex works but I don&#x27;t know why it also includes all numbers, so when I put some number it returns error.
My code:


```java
//pattern to find if there is any special character in string
    Pattern regex = Pattern.compile("[$&+,:;=?@#|'<>.-^*()%!]");
    //matcher to find if there is any special character in string
    Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(searchQuery.getSearchFor());

    if(matcher.find())
    {
        errors.rejectValue("searchFor", "wrong_pattern.SearchQuery.searchForSpecialCharacters","Special characters are not allowed!");
    }
```

Please don&#x27;t do that... little Unicode BABY ANGELs like this one  are dying! ◕◡◕ (← these are not images) (nor is the arrow!)
☺ And you are killing 20 years of DOS :-) (the last smiley is called WHITE SMILING FACE... Now it&#x27;s at 263A... But in ancient times it was ALT-1)
and his friend
☻ BLACK SMILING FACE... Now it&#x27;s at 263B... But in ancient times it was ALT-2
Try a negative match:
(this will ok only A-Z &quot;standard&quot; letters and &quot;standard&quot; digits.

```java
Pattern regex = Pattern.compile("[^A-Za-z0-9]");
```
