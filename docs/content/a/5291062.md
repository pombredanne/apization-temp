Is there a Mutex object in java or a way to create one?
I am asking because a Semaphore object initialized with 1 permit does not help me.
Think of this case:
if an exception happens at the first acquire, the release in the catch block will increase the permits, and the semaphore is no longer a binary semaphore.
Will the correct way be?
Will the above code ensure that the semaphore will be binary?


```java
try {
   semaphore.acquire();
   //do stuff
   semaphore.release();
} catch (Exception e) {
   semaphore.release();
}
try {
   semaphore.acquire();
   //do stuff
} catch (Exception e) {
   //exception stuff
} finally {
   semaphore.release();
}
```

See this page:  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-140767.html
It has a slightly different pattern which is (I think) what you are looking for:
In this usage, you&#x27;re only calling release() after a successful acquire()

```java
try {
  mutex.acquire();
  try {
    // do something
  } finally {
    mutex.release();
  }
} catch(InterruptedException ie) {
  // ...
}
```
