Had a conversation with a coworker the other day about this.
There&#x27;s the obvious which is to use a constructor, but what other ways are there?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5104630

There are four different ways to create objects in java:
A. Using new keyword
This is the most common way to create an object in java. Almost 99% of objects are created in this way.
B. Using Class.forName()
If we know the name of the class &amp; if it has a public default constructor we can create an object in this way.
C. Using clone()
The clone() can be used to create a copy of an existing object.
D. Using object deserialization
Object deserialization is nothing but creating an object from its serialized form.
You can read from here

```java
MyObject object = new MyObject();
MyObject object = (MyObject) Class.forName("subin.rnd.MyObject").newInstance();
MyObject anotherObject = new MyObject();
MyObject object = (MyObject) anotherObject.clone();
ObjectInputStream inStream = new ObjectInputStream(anInputStream );
MyObject object = (MyObject) inStream.readObject();
```
