I am trying to set command line arguments in a Netbeans 7.1 Java project on Windows 7 64 bit.
Netbeans is not passing the arguments I give it.
I go to Project --&gt; Properties --&gt; Run --&gt; and type the arguments next to &quot;Arguments&quot; however the arguments are not passed to the program.  How do I pass them?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/9168863

I am guessing that you are running the file using Run | Run File (or shift-F6) rather than Run | Run Main Project.  The NetBeans 7.1 help file (F1 is your friend!) states for the Arguments parameter:
Add arguments to pass to the main class during application execution.
  Note that arguments cannot be passed to individual files.
I verified this with a little snippet of code:
I set Run -&gt; Arguments to x y z.  When I ran the file by itself I got no output.  When I ran the project the output was:

```java
public class Junk
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        for (String s : args)
            System.out.println("arg -> " + s);
    }
}
arg -> x
arg -> y
arg -> z
```
