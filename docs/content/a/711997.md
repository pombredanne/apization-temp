combine paths in java
I would like to know if there is such a method in Java. Take this snippet as example :


```java
// this will output a/b
System.out.println(path_join("a","b"));
// a/b 
System.out.println(path_join("a","/b");
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/711997

This concerns Java versions 7 and earlier.
To quote a good answer to the same question:
If you want it back as a string later, you can call getPath(). Indeed, if you really wanted to mimic Path.Combine, you could just write something like:

```java
public static String combine (String path1, String path2) {
    File file1 = new File(path1);
    File file2 = new File(file1, path2);
    return file2.getPath();
}
```
