I am trying to convert an address specified by an IP number or a name, both in String (i.e. localhost or 127.0.0.1), into an InetAdress object. There&#x27;s no constructor but rather static methods that return an InetAddress. So if I get a host name it&#x27;s not a problem, but what if I get the IP number? There&#x27;s one method that gets byte[] but I&#x27;m not sure how that can help me. All other methods gets the host name.
InetAddress API documentation



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/5719553

You should be able to use getByName or getByAddress.
The host name can either be a machine
  name, such as &quot;java.sun.com&quot;, or a
  textual representation of its IP
  address
The method that takes a byte array can be used like this:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1");
byte[] ipAddr = new byte[]{127, 0, 0, 1};
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByAddress(ipAddr);
```
