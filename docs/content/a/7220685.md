This is a basic question but I can&#x27;t find an answer.  I&#x27;ve looked into floating point arithmetic and a few other topics but nothing has seemed to address this.  I&#x27;m sure I just have the wrong terminology.
Basically, I want to take two quantities - completed, and total - and divide them to come up with a percentage (of how much has been completed).  The quantities are longs.  Here&#x27;s the setup:
I&#x27;ve tried reassigning the result to a double - it prints 0.0.  Where am I going wrong?
Incidentally, the next step is to multiply this result by 100, which I assume should be easy once this small hurdle is stepped over.
BTW not homework here just plain old numskull-ness (and maybe too much coding today).


```java
long completed = 25000;
long total = 50000;

System.out.println(completed/total);  // Prints 0
```

Converting the output is too late; the calculation has already taken place in integer arithmetic.  You need to convert the inputs to double:
Note that you don&#x27;t actually need to convert both of them; so long as one is double, the other will be implicitly converted.  But I prefer to do both, for symmetry.

```java
System.out.println((double)completed/(double)total);
```
