I&#x27;m new to threads. I wanted to create some simple function working separately from main thread. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I&#x27;d just like to create new thread and do some stuff there independently of what&#x27;s happening on main thread. This code may look weird but I don&#x27;t have much experience with threading so far. Could you explain me what&#x27;s wrong with this?

```java
public static void main(String args[]){
      test z=new test();

      z.setBackground(Color.white);

      frame=new JFrame();
      frame.setSize(500,500);
      frame.add(z);
      frame.addKeyListener(z);
      frame.setVisible(true);

      one=new Thread(){
          public void run() {
              one.start();
              try{
                  System.out.println("Does it work?");
                  Thread.sleep(1000);
                  System.out.println("Nope, it doesnt...again.");

## Original code snippet

You are calling the one.start() method in the run method of your Thread. But the run method will only be called when a thread is already started. Do this instead:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
one = new Thread() {
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Does it work?");

            Thread.sleep(1000);

            System.out.println("Nope, it doesnt...again.");
        } catch(InterruptedException v) {
            System.out.println(v);
        }
    }  
};

one.start();
```
