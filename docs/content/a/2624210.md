I&#x27;m trying to think up a good hash function for strings.  And I was thinking it might be a good idea to sum up the unicode values for the first five characters in the string (assuming it has five, otherwise stop where it ends).  Would that be a good idea, or is it a bad one?
I am doing this in Java, but I wouldn&#x27;t imagine that would make much of a difference.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2624210

Usually hashes wouldn&#x27;t do sums, otherwise stop and pots will have the same hash.
and you wouldn&#x27;t limit it to the first n characters because otherwise house and houses would have the same hash.
Generally hashs take values and multiply it by a prime number (makes it more likely to generate unique hashes) So you could do something like:

```java
int hash = 7;
for (int i = 0; i < strlen; i++) {
    hash = hash*31 + charAt(i);
}
```
