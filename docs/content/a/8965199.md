When I&#x27;m trying to set up a socket server, I&#x27;ve got an error message:
Whole code is simplest as it can be:
I&#x27;m 100% sure that my ports are forwarded, Windows Firewall is off. Nothing blocks port 9999. What else can go wrong?


```java

As other people have pointed out, it is most likely related to another process using port 9999. On Windows, run the command:
And it should list anything there that&#x27;s hogging the port. Of course you&#x27;ll then have to go and manually kill those programs in Task Manager. If this still doesn&#x27;t work, replace the line:
With:
Of course replace 192.168.1.20 with your actual IP address, or use 127.0.0.1.

```java
netstat -a -n | grep "LIST"
serverSocket = new ServerSocket(9999);
InetAddress locIP = InetAddress.getByName("192.168.1.20");
serverSocket = new ServerSocket(9999, 0, locIP);
```
