I&#x27;ve made a little file writer:
Now I want to make a new line, just like you can do it with &quot;\n&quot; normally, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work...
Does anyone know how to make such a new line?
Thanks in advance! :)


```java
try {
        FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(new File("file.txt"), false);
        try {
            String sizeX = jTextField1.getText();
            String sizeY = jTextField2.getText();
            writer.write(sizeX);
            writer.write(sizeY);
            writer.flush();
            writer.close();
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        }
    } catch (IOException ex) {
    }
```


## Original code snippet

If you want to get new line characters used in current OS like \r\n for Windows, you can get them by
You can also use PrintStream and its println method which will add OS dependent line separator at the end of your string automatically
(BTW System.out is also instance of PrintStream).

```java
PrintStream fileStream = new PrintStream(new File("file.txt"));
fileStream.println("your data");
//         ^^^^^^^ will add OS line separator after data
```
