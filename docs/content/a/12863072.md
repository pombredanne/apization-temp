How to verify that a method is not called on an object&#x27;s dependency?
For example:
With the Foo test:


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
public interface Dependency {
    void someMethod();
}

public class Foo {
    public bar(final Dependency d) {
        ...
    }
}
public class FooTest {
    @Test
    public void dependencyIsNotCalled() {
        final Foo foo = new Foo(...);
        final Dependency dependency = mock(Dependency.class);
        foo.bar(dependency);
        **// verify here that someMethod was not called??**
    }
}
```


## Original code snippet

Even more meaningful :
The documentation of this feature is there ยง4 &quot;Verifying exact number of invocations / at least x / never&quot;, and the never javadoc is here.

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.never;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;

// ...

verify(dependency, never()).someMethod();
```
