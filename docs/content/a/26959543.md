Yes, yes I know that lots of questions were asked about this topic. But I still cannot find the solution to my problem. I have a property annotated Java object. For example Customer, like in this example. And I want a String representation of it. Google reccomends using JAXB for such purposes. But in all examples created XML file is printed to file or console, like this:
But I have to use this object and send over network in XML format. So I want to get a String which represents XML.
How can I do this?


<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
File file = new File("C:\\file.xml");
JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Customer.class);
Marshaller jaxbMarshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();

// output pretty printed
jaxbMarshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);

jaxbMarshaller.marshal(customer, file);
jaxbMarshaller.marshal(customer, System.out);
String xmlString = ...
sendOverNetwork(xmlString);
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/26959543

You can use the Marshaler&#x27;s method for marshaling which takes a Writer as parameter:
marshal(Object,Writer)
and pass it an Implementation which can build a String object
Direct Known Subclasses:
  BufferedWriter, CharArrayWriter, FilterWriter, OutputStreamWriter, PipedWriter, PrintWriter, StringWriter
Call its toString method to get the actual String value.
So doing:

```java
StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();
jaxbMarshaller.marshal(customer, sw);
String xmlString = sw.toString();
```
