I am using this code to convert a Set to a List:
I want to avoid creating a new list in each iteration of the loop. Is that possible?


```java
Map<String, List> mainMap = new HashMap<String, List>();

for(int i=0; i<something.size(); i++){
  Set set = getSet(...); //returns different result each time
  List listOfNames = new ArrayList(set);
  mainMap.put(differentKeyName,listOfNames);
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/8892424

You can use the List.addAll() method. It accepts a Collection as an argument, and your set is a Collection.
EDIT: as respond to the edit of the question.
It is easy to see that if you want to have a Map with Lists as values, in order to have k different values, you need to create k different lists.
Thus: You cannot avoid creating these lists at all, the lists will have to be created.
Possible work around:
Declare your Map as a Map&lt;String,Set&gt; or Map&lt;String,Collection&gt; instead, and just insert your set.

```java
mainList.addAll(set);
```
