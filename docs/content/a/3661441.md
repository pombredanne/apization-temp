How can I cast an Object to an int in java?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/3661441

If you&#x27;re sure that this object is an Integer :
Or, starting from Java 7, you can equivalently write:
Beware, it can throw a ClassCastException if your object isn&#x27;t an Integer and a NullPointerException if your object is null.
This way you assume that your Object is an Integer (the wrapped int) and you unbox it into an int.
int is a primitive so it can&#x27;t be stored as an Object, the only way is to have an int considered/boxed as an Integer then stored as an Object.
If your object is a String, then you can use the Integer.valueOf() method to convert it into a simple int :
It can throw a NumberFormatException if your object isn&#x27;t really a String with an integer as content.
