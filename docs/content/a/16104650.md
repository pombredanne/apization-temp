I&#x27;m having problems with using the BufferedReader
I want to print the 6 lines of a text file:
Now from what I can gather every time I call the readLine() method it automatically advances to the next line.
So I can&#x27;t use the condition br.readLine() != null since it&#x27;ll already advance it one line and I get the output:
What Condition do I use to check if there is still a new line in the text field.
Thanks in advance!


```java
public class Reader {

public static void main(String[]args) throws IOException{

    FileReader in = new FileReader("C:/test.txt");
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(in);

    while (br.readLine() != null) {
        System.out.println(br.readLine());
    }
    in.close();

}
Line 2
Line 4
Line 6
```

This is the problem:
You&#x27;ve got two calls to readLine - the first only checks that there&#x27;s a line (but reads it and throws it away) and the second reads the next line. You want:
Now we&#x27;re only calling readLine() once per loop iteration, and using the line that we&#x27;ve read both for the &quot;have we finished?&quot; and &quot;print out the line&quot; parts.

```java
while (br.readLine() != null) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
}
String line;
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(line);
}
```
