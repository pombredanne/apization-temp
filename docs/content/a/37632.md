What is reflection, and why is it useful?
I&#x27;m particularly interested in Java, but I assume the principles are the same in any language.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/37632

The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).
For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a &#x27;doSomething&#x27; method on it if one exists. Java&#x27;s static typing system isn&#x27;t really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called &#x27;doSomething&#x27; and then call it if you want to.
So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :
One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.
