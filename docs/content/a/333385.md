I need to read a properties files that&#x27;s buried in my package structure in com.al.common.email.templates.
I&#x27;ve tried everything and I can&#x27;t figure it out.
In the end, my code will be running in a servlet container, but I don&#x27;t want to depend on the container for anything. I write JUnit test cases and it needs to work in both.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/333385

When loading the Properties from a Class in the package com.al.common.email.templates you can use
(Add all the necessary exception handling).
If your class is not in that package, you need to aquire the InputStream slightly differently:
Relative paths (those without a leading &#x27;/&#x27;) in getResource()/getResourceAsStream() mean that the resource will be searched relative to the directory which represents the package the class is in.
Using java.lang.String.class.getResource(&quot;foo.txt&quot;) would search for the (inexistent) file /java/lang/String/foo.txt on the classpath.
Using an absolute path (one that starts with &#x27;/&#x27;) means that the current package is ignored.

Properties prop = new Properties();
InputStream in = getClass().getResourceAsStream("foo.properties");
prop.load(in);
in.close();
InputStream in = 
 getClass().getResourceAsStream("/com/al/common/email/templates/foo.properties");
```
