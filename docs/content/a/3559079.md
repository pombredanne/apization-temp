I want to initialize a String in Java, but that string needs to include quotes; for example: &quot;ROM&quot;. I tried doing:
but that doesn&#x27;t work. How can I include &quot;s within a string?


```java
String value = " "ROM" ";
```

In Java, you can escape quotes with \:

```java
String value = " \"ROM\" ";
```
