If I want to select an option of a dropdown box, there are several ways to do that. I always used:
But that didn&#x27;t work every time. Sometimes another option was selected. So I googled a little bit and found this piece of code which works every time:
But that works really really slow. If I have a long list with many items in it, it really takes too much time. So my question is, is there a solution which works every time and is fast?


```java
driver.findElement(By.id("selection")).sendKeys("Germany");
WebElement select = driver.findElement(By.id("selection"));
    List<WebElement> options = select.findElements(By.tagName("option"));
    for (WebElement option : options) {
        if("Germany".equals(option.getText()))
            option.click();
    }
```


## Original code snippet

You could try this:

```java
IWebElement dropDownListBox = driver.findElement(By.Id("selection"));
SelectElement clickThis = new SelectElement(dropDownListBox);
clickThis.SelectByText("Germany");
```
