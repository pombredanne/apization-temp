When using external iteration over an Iterable we use break or return from enhanced for-each loop as:
How can we break or return using the internal iteration in a Java 8 lambda expression like:


```java
for (SomeObject obj : someObjects) {
   if (some_condition_met) {
      break; // or return obj
   }
}
someObjects.forEach(obj -> {
   //what to do here?
})
```


## Original code snippet

If you need this, you shouldn&#x27;t use forEach, but one of the other methods available on streams; which one, depends on what your goal is.
For example, if the goal of this loop is to find the first element which matches some predicate:
(Note: This will not iterate the whole collection, because streams are lazily evaluated - it will stop at the first object that matches the condition).
If you just want to know if there&#x27;s an element in the collection for which the condition is true, you could use anyMatch:

```java
Optional<SomeObject> result =
    someObjects.stream().filter(obj -> some_condition_met).findFirst();
boolean result = someObjects.stream().anyMatch(obj -> some_condition_met);
```
