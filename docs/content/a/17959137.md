How do I find the difference in Days between two Joda-Time DateTime instances?
With ‘difference in days’ I mean if start is on Monday and end is on Tuesday I expect a return value of 1 regardless of the hour/minute/seconds of the start and end dates.
Days.daysBetween(start, end).getDays() gives me 0 if start is in the evening and end in the morning.
I&#x27;m also having the same issue with other date fields so I was hoping there would be a generic way to &#x27;ignore&#x27; the fields of lesser significance.
In other words, the months between Feb and 4 March would also be 1, as would the hours between 14:45 and 15:12 be. However the hour difference between 14:01 and 14:55 would be 0.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/17959137

Annoyingly, the withTimeAtStartOfDay answer is wrong, but only occasionally. You want:
It turns out that &quot;midnight/start of day&quot; sometimes means 1am (daylight savings happen this way in some places), which Days.daysBetween doesn&#x27;t handle properly.
Going via a LocalDate sidesteps the whole issue.

```java
Days.daysBetween(start.toLocalDate(), end.toLocalDate()).getDays()
// 5am on the 20th to 1pm on the 21st, October 2013, Brazil
DateTimeZone BRAZIL = DateTimeZone.forID("America/Sao_Paulo");
DateTime start = new DateTime(2013, 10, 20, 5, 0, 0, BRAZIL);
DateTime end = new DateTime(2013, 10, 21, 13, 0, 0, BRAZIL);
System.out.println(daysBetween(start.withTimeAtStartOfDay(),
                               end.withTimeAtStartOfDay()).getDays());
// prints 0
System.out.println(daysBetween(start.toLocalDate(),
                               end.toLocalDate()).getDays());
// prints 1
```
