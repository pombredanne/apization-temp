I want to get two ints, one divided by the other to get a decimal or percentage.
How can I get a percentage or decimal of these two ints?
(I&#x27;m not sure if it is right.. I&#x27;m probably way off...)
for example:
This is how I thought I could do it, but it didn&#x27;t work... I want to make the decimal (if there is one) into a percent out of 100 for example in this case it is %25. any ideas anyone?
Here is the correct code (thanks to Salvatore Previti!):
(btw, I am making a project using this for a quiz checking program that is why I need the percentage or decimal)


```java
int correct = 25;
int questionNum = 100;
float percent = correct/questionNum *100;
float correct = 25;
float questionNum = 100;
float percent = (correct * 100.0f) / questionNum;
```

If you don&#x27;t add .0f it will be treated like it is an integer, and an integer division is a lot different from a floating point division indeed :)
If you need an integer out of this you can of course cast the float or the double again in integer.
If you know your n value is less than 21474836 (that is (2 ^ 31 / 100)), you can do all using integer operations.
If you get NaN is because wathever you do you cannot divide for zero of course... it doesn&#x27;t make sense.

```java
float percent = (n * 100.0f) / v;
int percent = (int)((n * 100.0f) / v);
int percent = (n * 100) / v;
```
