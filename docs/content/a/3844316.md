I have a project with 2 packages:
In package (2) I have a text file ListStopWords.txt, in package (1) I have a class FileLoadder. Here is code in FileLoader:
But have this error:
Can you give a solution to fix it? Thanks.


```java
File file = new File("properties\\files\\ListStopWords.txt");
The system cannot find the path specified
```


## Original code snippet

If it&#x27;s already in the classpath, then just obtain it from the classpath. Don&#x27;t fiddle with relative paths in java.io.File. They are dependent on the current working directory over which you have totally no control from inside the Java code.
Assuming that ListStopWords.txt is in the same package as FileLoader class:
Or if all you&#x27;re after is an InputStream of it:
If the file is -as the package name hints- is actually a fullworthy properties file (containing key=value lines) with just the &quot;wrong&quot; extension, then you could feed it immediately to the load() method.
Note: when you&#x27;re trying to access it from inside static context, then use FileLoader.class instead of getClass() in above examples.

```java
URL url = getClass().getResource("ListStopWords.txt");
File file = new File(url.getPath());
InputStream input = getClass().getResourceAsStream("ListStopWords.txt");
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("ListStopWords.txt"));
```
