I&#x27;ve been using ArrayList recently in my android project at the office and I&#x27;m a bit confused between List and ArrayList, what is the difference of the two and what should I use?
Also I saw some implementations of it like.
What is the difference of those two instances?


```java
List<SomeObject> myList = new ArrayList<SomeObject>();

ArrayList<SomeObject> myList = new ArrayList<SomeObject>();
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/14903234

There&#x27;s no difference between list implementations in both of your examples.
There&#x27;s however a difference in a way you can further use variable myList in your code.
When you define your list as:
you can only call methods and reference members that are defined in the List interface.
If you define it as:
you&#x27;ll be able to invoke ArrayList-specific methods and use ArrayList-specific members in addition to those whose definitions are inherited from List.
Nevertheless, when you call a method of a List interface in the first example, which was implemented in ArrayList, the method from ArrayList will be called (because the List interface doesn&#x27;t implement any methods).
That&#x27;s called polymorphism. You can read up on it.

```java
List myList = new ArrayList();
ArrayList myList = new ArrayList();
```
