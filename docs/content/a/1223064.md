In Java is there a way to find out if first character of a string is a number?
One way is
and do the above all the way till 9, but that seems very inefficient.


```java
string.startsWith("1")
```

Note that this will allow any Unicode digit, not just 0-9. You might prefer:
Or the slower regex solutions:
However, with any of these methods, you must first be sure that the string isn&#x27;t empty. If it is, charAt(0) and substring(0, 1) will throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. startsWith does not have this problem.
To make the entire condition one line and avoid length checks, you can alter the regexes to the following:
If the condition does not appear in a tight loop in your program, the small performance hit for using regular expressions is not likely to be noticeable.

```java
Character.isDigit(string.charAt(0))
char c = string.charAt(0);
isDigit = (c >= '0' && c <= '9');
s.substring(0, 1).matches("\\d")
// or the equivalent
s.substring(0, 1).matches("[0-9]")
s.matches("\\d.*")
// or the equivalent
s.matches("[0-9].*")
```
