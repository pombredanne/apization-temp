In java.util.Calendar, January is defined as month 0, not month 1. Is there any specific reason to that ?
I have seen many people getting confused about that...

It&#x27;s just part of the horrendous mess which is the Java date/time API. Listing what&#x27;s wrong with it would take a very long time (and I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t know half of the problems). Admittedly working with dates and times is tricky, but aaargh anyway.
Do yourself a favour and use Joda Time instead, or possibly JSR-310.

One point which is in favour of using 0-based indexes is that it makes things like &quot;arrays of names&quot; easier:
Of course, this fails as soon as you get a calendar with 13 months... but at least the size specified is the number of months you expect.
This isn&#x27;t a good reason, but it&#x27;s a reason...
EDIT: As a comment sort of requests some ideas about what I think is wrong with Date/Calendar:

```java
// I "know" there are 12 months
String[] monthNames = new String[12]; // and populate...
String name = monthNames[calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH)];
```
