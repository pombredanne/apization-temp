I was wondering why in java constructors are not inherited? You know when you have a class like this:
Later when you inherit from Super, java will complain that there is no default constructor defined. The solution is obviously something like:
This code is repetitive, not DRY and useless (IMHO)... so that brings the question again:
Why java doesn&#x27;t support constructor inheritance? Is there any benefit in not allowing this inheritance?


```java
public class Super {

  public Super(ServiceA serviceA, ServiceB serviceB, ServiceC serviceC){
    this.serviceA = serviceA;
    //etc
  } 

}
public class Son extends Super{

  public Son(ServiceA serviceA, ServiceB serviceB, ServiceC serviceC){
    super(serviceA,serviceB,serviceC);
  }

}
```

Suppose constructors were inherited... then because every class eventually derives from Object, every class would end up with a parameterless constructor. That&#x27;s a bad idea. What exactly would you expect:
to do?
Now potentially there should be a way of easily creating the &quot;pass-through&quot; constructors which are fairly common, but I don&#x27;t think it should be the default. The parameters needed to construct a subclass are often different from those required by the superclass.

```java
FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream();
```
