How do I compare dates in between in Java?
Example:
date1 is 22-02-2010
 date2 is 07-04-2010 today 
 date3 is 25-12-2010
date3 is always greater than date1 and date2 is always today. How do I verify if today&#x27;s date is in between date1 and date 3?



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2592513

Date has before and after methods and can be compared to each other as follows:
For an inclusive comparison:
You could also give Joda-Time a go, but note that:
Joda-Time is the de facto standard date and time library for Java prior to Java SE 8. Users are now asked to migrate to java.time (JSR-310).
Back-ports are available for Java 6 and 7 as well as Android.

```java
if(todayDate.after(historyDate) && todayDate.before(futureDate)) {
    // In between
}
if(!historyDate.after(todayDate) && !futureDate.before(todayDate)) {
    /* historyDate <= todayDate <= futureDate */ 
}
```
