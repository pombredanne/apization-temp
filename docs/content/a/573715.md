In my Java app I need to get some files and directories.
This is the program structure:
guiclass loads the resourcesloader class which will load my resources (directory and file).
As to the file, I tried
in order to get the real path, but this way does not work.
I have no idea how to do the directory.


```java
./main.java
./package1/guiclass.java
./package1/resources/resourcesloader.java
./package1/resources/repository/modules/   -> this is the dir I need to get
./package1/resources/repository/SSL-Key/cert.jks    -> this is the file I need to get
resourcesloader.class.getClass().getResource("repository/SSL-Key/cert.jks").toString()
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/573715

Supply the path relative to the classloader, not the class you&#x27;re getting the loader from.  For instance:

```java
resourcesloader.class.getClassLoader().getResource("package1/resources/repository/SSL-Key/cert.jks").toString();
```
