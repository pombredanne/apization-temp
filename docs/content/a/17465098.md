In Java, I am trying to parse a string of format &quot;###.##&quot; to a float.  The string should always have 2 decimal places.
Even if the String has value 123.00, the float should also be 123.00, not 123.0.
This is what I have so far:
It prints:


```java
System.out.println("string liters of petrol putting in preferences is " + stringLitersOfPetrol);

Float litersOfPetrol = Float.parseFloat(stringLitersOfPetrol);

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("0.00");
df.setMaximumFractionDigits(2);

litersOfPetrol = Float.parseFloat(df.format(litersOfPetrol));

System.out.println("liters of petrol before putting in editor: " + litersOfPetrol);
string liters of petrol putting in preferences is 010.00 
liters of petrol before putting in editor: 10.0
```

This line is your problem:
There you formatted your float to string as you wanted, but but then that string got transformed again to a float, and then what you printed in stdout was  your float that got a standard formatting. Take a look at this code
And by the way, when you want to use decimals, forget the existence of double and float as others suggested and just use BigDecimal object, it will save you a lot of headache.

```java
litersOfPetrol = Float.parseFloat(df.format(litersOfPetrol));
import java.text.DecimalFormat;

String stringLitersOfPetrol = "123.00";
System.out.println("string liters of petrol putting in preferences is "+stringLitersOfPetrol);
Float litersOfPetrol=Float.parseFloat(stringLitersOfPetrol);
DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("0.00");
df.setMaximumFractionDigits(2);
stringLitersOfPetrol = df.format(litersOfPetrol);
System.out.println("liters of petrol before putting in editor : "+stringLitersOfPetrol);
```
