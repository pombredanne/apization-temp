I have been asked to use enhanced for loop in my coding. I have only been taught how to use traditional for loops, and as such don&#x27;t know about the differences between it and the enhanced for loop. How does an enhanced for loop differ from a traditional for loop, in Java? Are there any intricacies that I should look out for which tutorials tend not to mention?
