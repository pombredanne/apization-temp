Hoping someone can explain why I cannot retrieve an element from a HashSet.
Consider my HashSet containing a list of MyHashObjects with their hashCode() and equals() methods overridden correctly.
What I was hoping to do was to construct a MyHashObject myself, and set the relevant hash code properties to certain values.
I can query the HashSet to see if there &quot;equivalent&quot; objects in the set using the contains() method.
So even though contains() returns true for the 2 objects, they may not be == true.
How come then there is no get() method similar to how the contains() works?

## Original code snippet

If you know what element you want to retrieve, then you already have the element.  The only question for a Set to answer, given an element, is whether it contains() it or not.
If you want to iterator over the elements, just use a Set.iterator().
It sounds like what you&#x27;re trying to do is designate a canonical element for an equivalence class of elements.  You can use a Map&lt;MyObject,MyObject&gt; to do this.  See this SO question or this one for a discussion.
If you are really determined to find an element that .equals() your original element with the constraint that you MUST use the HashSet, I think you&#x27;re stuck with iterating over it and checking equals() yourself.  The API doesn&#x27;t let you grab something by its hash code.  So you could do:
Brute force and O(n) ugly, but if that&#x27;s what you need to do...

```java
MyObject findIfPresent(MyObject source, HashSet<MyObject> set)
{
   if (set.contains(source)) {
      for (MyObject obj : set) {
        if (obj.equals(source)) 
          return obj;
      } 
   }

  return null;
}
```
