I am getting the following error in RAD:
Could you please let me know what is the error and how to resolve it?


```java
java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 16: file:/E:/Program Files/IBM/SDP/runtimes/base......
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/4992334

There&#x27;s an illegal character at index 16.  I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t like the space in the path.  You can percent encode special characters like spaces.  Replace it with a %20 in this case.
The question I linked to above suggests using URLEncoder:

```java
String thePath = "file://E:/Program Files/IBM/SDP/runtimes/base";
thePath = URLEncoder.encode(thePath, "UTF-8");
```
