I am trying to find a way to take a char input from the keyboard.
I tried using:
This method doesn&#x27;t exist.
I tried taking c as a String. Yet, it would not always work in every case, since the other method I am calling from my method requires a char as an input. Therefore I have to find a way to explicitly take a char as an input.
Any help?

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
char c = reader.nextChar();
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/13942707

You could take the first character from Scanner.next:
To consume exactly one character you could use:
To consume strictly one character you could use:

<div class="code-logo"><img src="/stackoverflow.png" /></div>

```java
char c = reader.next().charAt(0);
char c = reader.findInLine(".").charAt(0);
char c = reader.next(".").charAt(0);
```
