I am a newbie in java and wanted to use curl in java. What is my question is curl built-in in java or I have to install it from any 3rd party source to use with Java. If so, how to install curl in java. I have been googling for a long time but didnt find any help. Hope anyone can help me out there.
Thanks in advance.



## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/2587000

You can make use of java.net.URL and/or java.net.URLConnection.
Also see the Oracle&#x27;s simple tutorial on the subject. It&#x27;s however a bit verbose. To end up with less verbose code, you may want to consider Apache HttpClient instead.
By the way: if your next question is &quot;How to process HTML result?&quot;, then the answer is &quot;Use a HTML parser. No, don&#x27;t use regex for this.&quot;.

```java
URL url = new URL("http://stackoverflow.com");

try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream(), "UTF-8"))) {
    for (String line; (line = reader.readLine()) != null;) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
}
```
