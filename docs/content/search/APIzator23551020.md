https://stackoverflow.com/q/23550985

I want to break a while loop of the format below which has an if statement. If that if statement is true, the while loop also must break. Any help would be appreciated.


```java
while(something.hasnext()) {
   do something...
   if(contains something to process){
      do something
      break if condition and while loop
   }
}
```


## Original code snippet

https://stackoverflow.com/a/23551020

if is not a loop. Simply call break;.
Contrived example:
If you were actually using nested loops, you would be able to use labels.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int i = 0;
  while (i++ < 10) {
    if (i == 5) break;
  }
  System.out.println(i); //prints 5
}
```
